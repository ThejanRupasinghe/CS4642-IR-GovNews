Restrict lighting of street lamps to between 7 pm and 5 am.

When the CEB was established in 1969 only 4% had access to electricity. By 1980 it had increased to 30%, while as of today it has increased to 90%. Our aim is to enable the entire country to have access to electricity. In comparison to other Asian countries even though Sri Lanka is in the forefront where electricity coverage is concerned, during this year we were faced with difficulties due to the lack of rain. Due to this situation several workshops on the conservation of energy by the sustainable energy authority has been organized island wide. However, even with such informative workshops being held, there is still no reduction in the number of street lamps that remain illuminated even during the day.
