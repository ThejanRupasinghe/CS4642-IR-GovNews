Instructions have been given to grand the employees leave with pay treating those two days on which they involved in strike

The Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that instructions have been given to CEB authority to grant the employees leave with pay treating those two days on which they involved in strike. The minister said this passing through a special news.
As stated, the employees who initiated the strike have no grudge with government or the ministry or ultimately with me. As an institution, it is an internal issue prevailing. Therefore, I appeal all of them to return to work tomorrow (18) helping to supply the power without interruption as the electricity has a direct influence on countrys economy. I am telling with responsibility that doors still are opened for negotiation.
