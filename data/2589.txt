by 2030 we should move away from the use of fossil fuels and turn to renewable power sources.

It is inevitable that by 2030 we should move away from the use of fossil fuels and turn to renewable power sources. Power and Energy Minister Champika Ranawake tells civil society representatives (CANSA) of SAARC countries.
Addressing a SAARC civil society representatives conference held in Pegasus Reef Hotel in Wattala, Power and Energy Minister Champika Ranawaka said that as at now carbon dioxide percentage in the atmosphere has increased by 44% and as a result global warming has increased by 0.85 centigrade points. It is estimated to grow by 2 centigrade points by 2030. It is therefore inevitable that we should develop alternative re-usable power source to face this dire situation.
About 20 years before now experts warned about impending climatic changes. We are now experiencing the outcome of those predictions. Today carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is inexorably increasing contributing to higher level of global warming poverty-stricken South Asian populations suffer most from these climatic changes. In 2011 and 2012 we experienced severe hardships due to failure of monsoons rains. Resultant dry weather caused crop destruction on a large scale. Government had to pay compensation to the famers, whereas it should have been the parties who contribute to global warming who should bean such costs. Both developing and developed countries contribute to global warming. We in the Asian region should set an example to other countries by introducing measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We should from now on work determinedly to avoid further damage to atmosphere and further global warming. World is running out of fossil fuels. We should find reasonable energy source as a matter of extreme urgency.
