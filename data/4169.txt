Assistance from South Africa to fulfill coal requirements in Sri Lanka

It is important to ensure an uninterrupted supply of coal to the Norochcholai Power plant as it is a major contributor to the national electricity supply in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, a discussion had been held at the ministry of power and renewable energy with the High Commissioner of South Africa to provide high quality coal at concessionary rates to Sri Lanka as a country which is a key supplier of coal to the world market. 
The discussions were held between Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the minister of power and renewable energy and Mr.Geoff Q.M. Doidge, the High Commissioner of South Africa. The main objective of the meeting was to reach an agreement between two countries on importing coal. The minister said that the High Commissioner had agreed to support Sri Lanka in this endeavour. Mr Siyambalapitiya wants further negotiations to reach a more favourable outcome to Sri Lanka and bring it to the notice of the President Maithripala Sirisena and the cabinet of the Ministers.
Minister Siyambalapitiya further emphasized that the government is expecting to strengthen the long term diplomatic ties between the countries and to assist the expansions of alternative energy sources in South Africa as a solution to meet its high electricity demand.
