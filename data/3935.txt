Towards an energy independent SAARC region by the year 2030

We can liberate from energy dependency in a future day if we put more weight on green energy and less weight on fossil fuels which is much more popular.
The former president of India Dr. Abdul Kalam emphasized the importance of working together as the SAARC region to become an energy independent and a non-aligned region by the year 2030.
Further expressing his views he said,
We can only get the independence from fossil fuels if we reduce the usage of fossil fuels. I suggest that SAARC countries should develop a 100 million Dollar fund to do research on green energy.
India had been launched two satellites into orbit to measure the changes occur in the atmosphere. If both Sri Lanka and India jointly launch a new satellite, it will help to the establishment of green oceans and green nations.
The minister of power and energy Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka participating at the event. . . .
As a country Sri Lanka is ahead of other countries in education, health, life expectancy and women empowerment. But it is at a low level regarding the knowledge economy and in innovations. Sri Lanka is in the 105th position in innovations out from 143 countries of the world. The greatest challenge ahead of us is energy sufficiency and how to escape from the trap of middle income country.
We must find our own ways to achieve upper income country status. In its way forward we have to win four challenges.
At first, country should gain the economic success through a sustainable development process. Second one is the conservation of the environment by protecting the bio diversity. The next is to create a social equity without cast creed religion and social class. The last but not the least is the achievement of individual happiness. These four factors help to create social prosperity and economical balanced nation. He said.
