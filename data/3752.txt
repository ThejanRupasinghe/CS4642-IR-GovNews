Meeting a national need by lighting up Mihintale

We are expecting to electrify the entire district of Anuradhapura covering up all its remote and rural villages. We are not worrying about 100 days but we are concern on completing the 100 works within that stipulated time period. Provisioning of electricity to the people of the whole country is important within this 100 day program. The minister of power and energy Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka said handing over ceremony of an electricity generator to the sacred site of Mihintale.
Ceylon Electricity Board donated this electricity generator with the sponsorship of CMEC. We had already donated power generators also to other sacred places such as the temple of tooth relic of Kandy and eight sacred places of Anuradhapura. When there is a breakdown of electricity, those generators can be used to provide electricity.
Some people are asking what we had done within these 100 days. We have to tell them that we have given a subsidy for fuel for every person irrespective of those who have voted us. Likewise by completing all the electricity projects, we will make Sri Lanka the only single country in South Asia which provide electricity for 24 hour a day.
Senior officials of the ministry of power and energy and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) participated at this event.
