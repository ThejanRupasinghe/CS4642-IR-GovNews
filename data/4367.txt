A revolutionary change in the renewable energy sector through Solar energy power projects

Hambantota district will achieve 100% electrification before April. Emphasized Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya the minister of power and renewable energy.
It is only six months after I resumed duties in this ministry. At this short period of time I was able to identify some main issues in this ministry and to provide speedy solutions for them. One of the major issues I came across was the problem of manpower contract employees. We absorbed 2500 of them to the permanent carder of CEB within two months, facing a lot of challenges. I am happy to say to the balance employees that their problem will be solved before the end of June. My way of solving problems is by joining hands together by affected parties instead pointing out fingers on others. When taking this much efforts people have to think a little before protesting demanding the permanency. he said.
Parallel to this inspection visit, the progress review meeting of the Hambanatota district was held with the patronage of the minister at the district secretary office Hambantota. The minister said that all the households who do not have electricity at present and all those who already applied for electricity will be provided with electricity. He also requested the state officers to take part actively in this effort to uplift the lives of the people of this country.
