Power to the poor Viduli Athwela

Inaugurating the Viduliyata Athwelak scheme to provide financial assistance to the poor  loans up to Rs.30,000  to get electricity, Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka today said millions of poor families are waiting without electricity despite power cables running over their homes.
Those who do not have money for wiring and electricity connections can now obtain a loan from the Samurdhi Bank. We want to extend this facility to small and medium scale industrialists as they are a major part of the development process in the country, Minister Ranawaka said.
Chief Guest of the event Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa commended the move by two major state sector institutions  the CEB and the Samurdhi Bank  to implement another people-friendly programme which is likely to make significantly contributions to the countrys progress.
He added that the policies adopted by Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka have made power to all by 2012, a reachable target.
