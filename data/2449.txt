By increasing energy efficiency and minimizing wastage there could be a significant reduction in Power Bills.


We all would like to have to pay less for our electricity consumption. Considering the cost of living today, it is increasingly difficult for us to meet our electricity costs, but is is within the ability of the consumer to minimize their power bills through the use of electricity sparingly. Through the careful consumption of electricity you could save a considerable amount of money. Accordingly you not only save your own money but also contribute to the progress of the countrys power and energy sector progress as well.
The Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka made these comments addressing the staff of the Bank of Ceylon Headquarters at a workshop on the topic of conservation of power
This workshop was organized by the Renewable Energy Authority with the aim of reducing the cost of electricity bills. This workshop is the 4th in a series targeting both the private and state sector.
