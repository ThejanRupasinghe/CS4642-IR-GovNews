Electricity demand dropped by 30% due to heavy rain

The recent weather condition with cyclonic rains had resulted in a 30% drop in the daily electricity demand according to the system control centre reports from Ceylon Electricity Board. The reports stated that reduced usage of electric fans and air conditioners during the cold climate associated with continuous rain had a direct impact on the above factor. CEB further declared that the restricted usage of television and other electric appliances due to the lightening effects in the past few days also contributed to the drop in the electricity demand.
