Rivi Aruna project launched from Kegalle

Free Solar power generation kits for selected secred places
Minister Siyambalapitiya expressed his ideas participating at a ceremony held at Sri Suvisuddarama temple, Vaendala, Kegalle in parallel with the world environment day. The project has been organized by the renewable energy authority with the guidance of the ministry of power and renewable energy. It has been planned to provide 2 KW solar power kit for selected sacred places island wide. The renewable energy authority bares a cost of Rs.600, 000 for each solar power kit.
Earlier people could fix a solar power kit in his house and produce electricity for their own consumption. But there was no way to give the excess energy to the CEB and to get some additional payment. But under the projects Rivi Aruna and Net Metering, people can apply for a loan to install a solar power kit in their houses. Now we are ready to pay a reasonable amount to the excess electricity supplied to the national grid. he said.
