Together with unity we face challenges ahead

Together with unity we face challenges without pointing finger to each other. said Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya the minister of power and renewable energy. He said this at the inauguration of Shramadana Week at Anuradhapura sacred city.
The length of all cables in the electricity distribution network is nearly two hundred thousand. Employees of CEB are devoted to fulfill the consumer requirements through this network. Today, our objective is to maintain these assets to provide an excellent service to our consumers. During this week we are trying to inculcate the practices of facing the challenges by unity among our employees.
During this program we try to attend the electricity breakdowns immediately with the highest level of coordination and to restore the service back soon as possible. We can show the team spirit of our employees that leads to a great contribution to the electricity consumers. he said.
