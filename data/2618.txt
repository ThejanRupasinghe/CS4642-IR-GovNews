LECO Projects introduces a new series of surge protectors

A recent study by LECO Projects, a subsidiary of Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Limited has emphasized that the lightning threat has increased in parallel to the current weather condition placing the electric circuits and appliances at a high risk of damage. Head of engineering unit, LECO Projects Dr. Narendra De Silva has pointed out that a similar risk may occur in high voltage atmospheres even without a lightning condition. As a result of comprehensive research on the above subject LECO Projects had invented 04 new surge protectors which were introduced to the minister of power and energy Patali Champika Ranawaka on 24th October.
