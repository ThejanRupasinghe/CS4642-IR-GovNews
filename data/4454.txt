Battle for Solar Energy begins from Presidents house

The Governments new community based power generation project Soorya Bala Sangramaya or Battle for Solar Energy commenced Tuesday from  President Maithripala Sirisenas official residence.
In a move to boost the sustainable power generation in the country, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has planned to transform every house to a micro power plant.
The Battle for Solar Energy program will encourage the consumers to join in power generation by installing small solar power plants established on the roofs of their houses to meet their energy requirements.
The programs will establish micro solar power units in one million houses throughout the country. The one million houses will be connected to a net metering system and solar panels will be provided to the households at a concessionary rate. The power supplier Ceylon Electricity Board will purchase excess power generated from them.
The project commenced on 6 September from the Presidents official residence with the signing of the agreement by the Secretary to the President P.B. Abeykoon and General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board N.C. Wickramasekara. President Sirisenas official residence will be transformed into a small power plant as the first measure of the project.
The inauguration ceremony of the Battle for Solar Energy program took place at the BMICH after the signing ceremony. The pilot project of the Soorya Bala Sangramaya program, which aims to reduce Carbon Dioxide emissions from thermal power plants to 150,000 metric tons per year, will be implemented in Negombo and Kotte areas. The Ministry expects the program to add another 1000 megawatts to the national grid by the year 2025.
The program is organised by the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority and Lanka Electricity Company Limited
