Nominating top ofiicials by the political authority is a usual thing in the government institutions. But the nominee should fulfill the requirements necessary to hold that position. Therefore a special committee has been appointed to evaluate the qualifications required to hold those positions. said Mr.Ranjith Siyambalapitiya the minister of power and renewable energy.
