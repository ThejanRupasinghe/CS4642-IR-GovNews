Four islands in North to receive electricity

The Ministry of Power and Energy stated that four islands off the Northern part of the island will receive electricity supply through renewable energy sources by the end of 2013. These islands have not had electricity so far due to its inability to obtain electricity through the National Grid.
This project will receive technical and financial assistance from the Korean Government. The islands that are slated to receive electricity supply are Delf, Nainathivu also known as Nagadeepa, Analathivu and Elivathivu.
Currently the inhabitants of these islands fulfill their electricity requirements through diesel generators. Around 293 out of 1331 families residing on the Delf island obtain electricity through these Diesel generators, while 481 families out of 874, and 80 out of 177 families on Elivathivu island as well as 164 out of 585 families living on the Analathivu island obtain electricity through Diesel generators.
The minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka and the Korean ambassador in Sri Lanka Choi Jong Moon embarked on an inspection tour of the Delf Island on Wednesday. The Korean ambassador stated that currently the apparel industry on the island which currently operates on Diesel generated power with the assistance of the Navy will be able to reduce their electricity cost by 25% once the renewable energy power supply is connected. This he said will no doubt help the 120 female workers employed.
The Minister and the Korean Ambassador distributed 25 solar power generation kits to the residents of Delf as a symbolic gesture. This will enable them to power two light bulbs and charge their mobile phone batteries.
