Demand management of Electricity to save 500MW

This would be a year that we have to face many challenges in electricity generation. The main reason is the availability of hydro power which is a key factor for electricity generation. The availability of hydro resources arises due to prevailing weather conditions. We hope to present three cabinet papers within this year to ensure the provision of electricity in an efficient manner as expected by the public.
Demand side management of electricity is significant and a common topic today, in all occasions wherever discussions held regarding electricity. We are being preparing to implement demand side management from about one year. Now this concept had gone a long way through complex processes by establishing a president task force, sharing responsibilities etc. Leadership of the program was offered to the Hon. President and we are happy about it said Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the minister of power and renewable energy.
The minister said that at the opening ceremony of the new office of renewable energy authority for power sector demand side management at , Albert Crescent, Colombo 07. Cheapest source energy today is through solar power and the usage of fossil fuels can be halted from generating electricity by using solar energy.
Facing challenges is a part of a life. I believe our ministry can overcome any challenge as it filled with unity, discussions, and consensus. Therefore we can move forward successfully. Through this demand management in the power sector we are planning to save a cost equal to build a 500MW power station.
Mr.Ajith P.Perera deputy minister of power and renewable energy, Dr. Suren Batagoda, secretary to the ministry of power and renewable energy, Chairman of the Sustainable energy authority and Senior officials participated at this occasion.
