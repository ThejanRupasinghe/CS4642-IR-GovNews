Ranjith Siyambalapitiya.The Minister, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya who expressed his viewOut of total power generation in our country, over 40% of electricity is generated from hydropower and which is a matter on which we should be proud of. Since the cost for our power generation is shared through several means, we can be able to generate electricity with a least cost in a more efficient environment friendly manner. However, a trend of difference in receipt of rain being prevailing for many years has become a big issue. For many years, monsoon rain did not experience properly and therefore in 2016, the overall capacity of power generation in our country had declined up to 26%. Due to this nature of reasons, even in last 1950s Sri Lanka had initiated to create an artificial rain with the technical assistance of Thailand which is the only country in the world who has the patron rights certificate. If this facility initiated, thereby three areas like hydropower generation, agriculture and drinking water would reach special benefits he further added.Thailand Ambassador His Excellency Chulamanee Chartsuwar and including special delegates were participated in this conference. Many experts and technical experts from Department of Metrology, Ministry of Mahaweli, Sri Lanka Air-Force, Department of Irrigation etc. in Sri Lanka participated in this conference with a view to gain technical knowledge on creation of artificial rain. The Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, Dr. B.M.S.

This Authority is to be shifted to a permanent building and thereby its functions will be regularized. This building is a special structure. Sustainable Energy Authority will move to an environment friendly constructed building. This is an environment friendly structure. Sustainable Energy Authority is prepared to use every solar x-ray and every drop of water without wasting. That is very important. People have kept faith on this Authority. Therefore, Sustainable Energy Authority should function as a role player in a manner where such faith kept by people upon the Authority is protected.

He will be blessed by everyone at this moment, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.The Minister pointed out this while he was attending the event of laying foundation stone to the environment friendly building which is proposed to construct for Sustainable Energy Authority. It has been estimated that this new building will be constructed at the cost of 550 million rupees.Further, Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya stated.I find the Sustainable Energy Authority Act as a very constructive Act among the other existing laws in Sri Lanka. I have not come across to such a constructive and comprehensive Act. Provisions are available in this said Act to undertake many things related to this sector and its progress. I implore for blessing to have many creative activities being at this building. Most of the time, if we start a work to do that would take a long and long period of time to complete it.

One matter generally attracted would not take much time to get socialized. But, unfortunately useless petty things are quickly getting into socialization. However, making this type of concept into socialization is a very hard struggle. Therefore, steps will be taken to make each and every house enabling to become as power generating unit and as well as to make the people aware through provision of solar power packages to all places of worship and in particular to government institutions. Today, we have provided all Divisional Secretariat Offices in District of Kegalle with solar power packages. From today onwards, the electricity bills of these offices would become zero, not only that but also all houses in Sri Lanka become rapidly as power generating units by bringing the concept of generation of solar power even among the staff working in such offices the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Hon.

Wimalasurendra at his time worked a lot to bring this good concept of hydropower generation and hydropower electricity into the society. Wimalasurendra prepared many plans and submitted, but then white people did not accept such plans. Finally, Wimalasurendra went to Parliament through election, and he established his hydropower station. Sooriyabala Sangramaya is also that of one. Then Wimalasurendra being in Parliament made his effort of hydropower generation succeeded. However, today even I being in Parliament implement such a policy, succeeding is a very difficult task the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy said.The Minister gave this statement while he was attending an event of distribution of solar power packages to Yattiyantota Divisional Secretariat Office of Kegalle District held in last couple of days.The Minister further stated that.,If we generate one unit of electricity from gas we have to spend more than Rs.40.00. However, such unit of electricity can be generated from hydropower at a mere rate of Rs.4.00. Power generation from gas will bring many environmental consequences. Today, we have reached maximum level in hydropower generation. By now, all the reservoirs for hydropower generation are in ending stage. Once Broadland Reservoir, Morogolla Reservoir and Seethawakka Power Project are completed, all reservoirs used for hydropower generation will come to end. Small Hydropower stations have also been established and completed. At the time of construction of Broadland Reservoir a big issue appeared saying that water rafting might have been affected. However, it has been able to control such water rafting better than earlier. With that example, when a merit task is undertaken, we all have to work with good understanding, and be helpful to bring such merit to the community. I hope you all would cooperate and achieve the merit together. Therefore, I implore that strength and courage should come to us to carry out such task.Senior officials of Ceylon Electricity Board including politicians from the area, and as well as a big crowed of people from that area participated at this event.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=4931", "title": "Make Consumers and whole Society benefited at large through Sooriyabala Sangramaya as Wimalasurendra then introduced the hydropower concept into Society"},

But when we are purchaseing a unit from them we pay Rs. 22 on average. Eventhough there is such a benefit, those less income people are not coming forward to get this benefit. Their involvement to this scheme is at a very low level. The main reason is their mentality. That mentality wont allow them to think about this benefit. They are more concern of fulfilling their primary needs than joining this scheme.Therefore, I request from the companies which are providing solar panels to fix these panels on their roofs enabling them to cover their electricity bill and to have an additional income.

Today, the electricity requirement of the country is been generated mainly by thermal energy through Diesel generators. Owners of these diesel power stations influenced the electricity board in many ways. We decided to shut down three of these diesel power stations this year to stop that mafia. With this closure there will be more and more attacks against the ministry of power and energy as well as myself. Also there will be false propaganda like the one that appeared last week about the likelihood of a fuel shortage and a power cut. Those people will also try to create trade union actions such as strikes to make the situation worse. But we do not take a step back. The minister of power and energy Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka said today (15th May) at a press conference held in the ministry.According to the plan ACE power generation Matera (20 MW), ACE power generation Embilipitiya (100 MW) and Heladhanavi Power Station Puttalam. (100 MW) has been decided to shut down. With this decision the electricity board will be able to save Rs. 3000-5000 millions which had been paid for the owners as capacity prices. the minister insisted. The minister further said that the electricity board has to pay the capacity charge even whether they were supplying the electricity to the grid or not. With this closure the amount that is paying as the capacity charge can be saved.Minister Ranawaka further said,Because of the electricity conserving methods we adopted in 2012, the necessity to build up large scale power plants has been ceased. According to the forecasts of the Ceylon electricity board, there would be a demand for electricity of 4000MW by now with the usage of old incandescent bulbs. But with this conservation process now we need only 2300 MW in the night time.That means 85% of people had been changed to CFL and LED lighting for their domestic lighting purposes. If it has not happened, by now it has to build up more diesel power stations to meet the electricity demand. If the demand continued as forecasted, we would never be able to allow these thermal power plants to retire.Recently, I made a request to the cabinet to stop 5 tenders which had been supplied fuel to the petroleum corporation without the required formalities. The cabinet granted the permission. The very next day propaganda was launched saying that there would be a shortage of fuel as well as a price hike of oil in the near future. This is how the things happening in this country. We would not give up our efforts towards safeguarding the energy sector with any of these influences.

She is the daughter of MP for Pelmadulla and deputy minister of Industry and Scientific Affairs and the Governer of the Wayamba province the late Dharmadasa Wanniarachchi. Pavithra Wanniarachchi who entered politics as an MP for the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, was elected to parliament in 1994 as the Deputy Minister for Health, Social Services and Highways. Since 2000 to date she has been functioning in the capacity of the Cabinet Minister for plan implementation, Samurdhi activities and eradicating poverty, Youth Services, National Heritage and Cultural Affairs, and prior to her present appointment she was also functioning in the capacity of the Minister of Technology and Research. Wanniarachchi is also the deputy secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and is in charge of the partys womens wing.Subsequent to assuming duties with the blessings of the Maha Sangha the minister said that one of the main reasons for complications arising in the power and energy sector is the high production cost. Therefore instead of burdening the consumer with the additional costs, we must endeavor to solve the issues plaguing this sector, and find appropriate solutions. I anticipate the untiring support of the deputy minister and all other institutions affiliated to the ministry of power and energy in achieving the task of achieving Sri Lankas total electrification target, which is currently at 94% TO 100% by the end of this year, she said.Several other ministers including the minister of Economic Development Basil Rajapaksa, Deputy Minister of Power and Energy Premalal Jayasekera, Chairman of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Kanchana Jayaratne, the Director General of the Media Centre for National Security Lakshman Hullugalle and several other dignitaries also participated in the ceremony.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3040", "title": "Pavithra Wanniarachchi assumes duties as the new MInister of Power and Energy"},

This power plant built at a total cost of Rs. 3500 million, is solely on local investment by Lanka Electric Company (LECO) and owned by the CEB.The media spokesman to the Ministry of Power and Energy Dhanushka Ramanayake said that the plan to establish thermal power plants owned by the CEB in the Jaffna Peninsula was taken toward the latter part of June. Around 121,000 families will receive electricity round the clock from this power plant, fulfilling the electrification requirement of the Jaffna peninsula completely, he said.The heavy fuel thermal power plant consists of three turbines, each having the capacity of producing eight MW of power. The total power capacity of this heavy fuel thermal power plant is 24 MW. The cost per unit of power generation through heavy fuel is around Rs. 15.93 whereas the current cost to generate a unit through thermal power generation is Rs. 19.10, he said.The Additional General Manager (projects) of CEB Shavindranath Fernando said that this is the first heavy fuel thermal power station that has completed the Construction work within a short span of around six months. The planning, and selection of the land at Chunnakkam, establishing of operations offices, power houses and generators was conducted and experimental operations were also conducted before the power generation was added onto the national grid in that short period. Another unique feature was that the technical operations and establishing of generators plus the complete construction was carried out by a local firm Lanka Transformers, he said.The project director M.S.A.K. Gunaratne said that the testing stage of power generation of the power plant began on 26 December, while the 24 MW capacity was added onto the national grid yesterday. Although the test power generations were to commence on 16 January, due to the instructions of the ministry of power and energy to expedite the process, it was commissioned earlier than anticipated, he said.Meanwhile the minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka said that with the commissioning of the new Heavy Fuel Thermal Power Station, the older high cost thermal power plants will be decommissioned systematically. The contract period of the thermal power plant Agrico ended on 31 December, and its contract will not be renewed. Furthermore with the establishment of these CEB owned power stations, the colossal loss of Rs. 2800 million the government has to bear to purchase power from private power stations can now be reduced to around Rs. 1500 million, added the minister.The project Director for Lakdhanavi Dhammika Nanayakkara said that construction work of the Jaffna heavy fuel power plant commenced on 01 May last year with around 100 workers. By August last year however, around 500 workers were engaged in round the clock operations in order to complete the construction work ahead of schedule to facilitate the advanced commissioning of this power plant. The team of local engineers worked with utmost dedication round the clock in order to complete the construction and installation, which is highly commendable, he said.The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) was done by the local engineers while the design and installation was handled by the turn key contractor Lakdhanavi Limited. The power generation is done through three engines with a capacity of8.5MW each, while the technology used is Diesel Engine Technology. The annual electricity generation of the Jaffna power station is 190 million units.Nanayakkara further stated that the regular thermal power plants run on regular Diesel which is of high cost. In this case if the Jaffna power station was built to use the regular diesel technology, power would have to be generated by standby generators, which would have been higher in operational costs. Hence with the use of the furnace oil the cost factor has been reduced dramatically, he added.The Norochcholai thermal power plant and the Kerawalapitiya power stations are also based on turbine technology. The Norochcholai power station utilizes a steam turbine technology for power generation while it uses coal as fuel. Kerawalapitiya posses two turbines of gas and steam while it operates on heavy fuel (Furnace oil), said Nanayakkara.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=2686", "title": "Heavy fuel thermal power plant in Jaffna officially commissioned"},

The funding for this project was granted at concessionary interest rates by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).The ministry of power and energy pointed out that subsequent to the signing of the 06 October 1987 Indo Sri Lanka peace accord, and three days after the commencement of the Pawan offensive, the tigers completely destroyed the Northern peninsula power network. Since then the Northern peninsula had not been connected to the national grid.The second stage of the project which is the establishment of the 132 KW high tension transmission line from Kilinochchi to Chunnakkam, is expected to be completed by mid 2013 and energized.

Minister of Power and Energy Pavithra Wanniarachchi.Joining the ceremony she further stated that the Ceylon Electricity Board recorded a substantial profit in 2013 and that it is expected to record a similar profit in 2014 too.When our Hon President handed over this Ministry to me in 2013 he told me to ensure that the whole country should be provided with electricity in 2014. As a person who was born in the village and brought up in the village and who loved the people of the village knows the suffering of the poor man in the village without electricity. That is why he got activated and decided to give electricity to the village.Our President really and truly loves children. As a villager he is well aware of the hardship and the trauma that the village children had to undergo when they had to trudge to school passing muddy holes while carrying their shoes in their hands. The trauma and the difficulties they had to undergo when studying with the light of the kerosene lamp. It is because of these reasons that he took a policy decision to develop the village.It is the hope and wish of the leader of our country that we should take our children to a higher place and level in society than their parents. The hearts and minds of our people are strong, and they never sway in times and situations of adversity and have the courage and the back bone to stand up to any adverse situation. They can work hard too. If we help the children of these parents with the aforementioned qualities we cannot even imagine where they would finally end up.Today our country is in the process of standing up and developing. All villages are developing. By the end of this year the country will get 100 % electrification .Even though the villages did have electricity, at the time I took over this portfolio there were no electricity poles near the houses. Therefore the people were unable to get electricity. They had to obtain the electricity at their own expense. But I changed the Electricity Bill. The onus of providing electricity poles right up to the houses were vested by me in the Ceylon Electricity Board. I did not stop there. Our people who have to put up a severe battle with the elements have no means to get the electricity from the electricity pole that is fixed in front of their house, nor do they have the means to wire their houses. It is to solve this problem that it was decided to grant a loan of Rs. 40,000/- which could be settled within 6 years, and which includes the cost of electricity consumption too. It has been arranged to set off this loan plus the electricity consumption within these 6 years of the loan payment. This project has been planned and initiated as a concessionary means of providing electricity to the village folk who live under various difficulties, to obtain electricity. By successfully providing electricity to the village folk their standard of living, their economic sustainability and social and cultural values have undergone a massive metamorphosis.The era of Mahinda Rajapakse is a period of huge change. This change is an era where the lives of the poor man have been uplifted. What did the UNP do for us? No roads were built, no electricity was given, no schools were built. All they came for were the votes.The Ceylon Electricity Board sustained losses for many number of years. It joined the list of institutions that sustained losses according to the COPE Report.

It was also pointed out by Hon Minister Power and Energy, PavithraWanniarachchi, Attorney at Law, thatit is a very important factor to receive the cooperationof the public when national projects are launched.She further stated that theBroadlands Hydro Power Project is amajor National project and the fact that the publiccooperated with the Government without being misled by narrow political influences and ideologies, is a factor to be appreciated and admired. It was also stated that a high amount in compensationwas ableto be paid to whose who lost their lands becausethe His Excellency the President is a leaderwho always acted on behalf of the common man.At this function Hon. Minister Power and Energy, PavithraWanniarachchi, Attorney at Law,further stated, .. quoteI always told the Ceylon Electricity Board to take decisions taking in to consideration the people who lost their lands. That is why we were able to pay you a reasonable amount. WE all know that MahindaRajapakse is a leaderwho always visualized from the common mans perspective. While he thinks like this,we as Ministers also take similar policy decisions. It is essential that as a Government it is important to launch projects for the development of the country. In so doing,people lose their land and property. It is a great sacrifice by these people who took thedecision to leave their traditional lands,where they had lived all their lives in a familiar environment and made this sacrifice on behalf of the country.It costs over S. 30/- to produce 1 Unit of electricity using Thermal Power. But the cost incurred to produce 1 Unit of electricity using Hydro Power is only Rs. 3/-. When we have to spend Rs. 30/- to produce 1 Unit of electricity the cost is recovered from the people of this country. However,when the cost to produce 1 Unit of electricity is only Rs. 3/- to 4/-, then also the benefit is accrued to the people of this country. Wecant all be the President of this country. But there are certain ways and meansto workfor the country. One is to be a member of the political process initiated by the leader who is taking this country forward and also safeguarding it UNQUOTE.The Hon. Minister also said that today the public isprovoked for the slightest thing by extremist elements. There are extremists both in the Buddhist and Muslimreligioussectors.These extremist elements try to incite the public with their extremist ideas. It is our responsibility not to get incited by these elements. Sri Lankans are not a set of people who can be swayed by unsubstanciated rhetoric or jumping into conclusions by seeing things on the surface. The people of this country is a pragmatic lot and always act after weighing the pros and cons of any situation. It is because of this quality that theythought very broadly and decided to sacrifice their lands for the development of the country.There is a certain section in this country who have instilled poisonous ideas in the minds of the people and wait till trouble erupts. This is very easy. But practically it is difficult to execute these ideas. If a country is to be developed, and if projects and schemes are to be implemented then lands like this will be lost. It is therefore a very noble act to think and sacrifice your lands for such a cause said Hon. Minister, PavithraWanniarachchi.Present on this occasion were the people who handed over their lands for the Broadlands Hydro Power Scheme, Chairman of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Mr. KanchanaJayaratne, General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board Mr. Shavindranath Fernando, Director of the Broadlands Hydro Power Scheme Prof. Kamal Laksiri and other officials", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3364", "title": "Sri lankans are not  people who react to instigations of racism,"},
{"date": "10 Sep", "text": "Hon Minister of Power & Energy, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Attorney at Law, stated that the CEB will not be an institution riddled with Debt burdens any more and that it has now transformed itself to a people friendly institution serving the people, under the able and far seeing leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajaapakse. She stated this when she attended the ceremony to handover the concessionary loans to get electricity connections for the houses of low income families which started from the Ratnapura district.Under the concept of Mahinda Chinthana to ensure the upliftment of low income village families, the Ceylon Electricity Board, under the direction of the Ministry of Power and Energy too, has launched many schemes. Under this scheme a maximum amount of Rs. 40,000 will be given as a concessionary loan to be paid within 6 years, under an instalment scheme , which includes the electricity bill.Speaking further at this inauguration ceremony the Hon Minister if Power and Energy, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Attorney at Law stated that in order to speed up the programme to provide electricity to all households in the inland, this concessionary loan scheme was introduced and inaugurated under the guidance and advice of His Excellency the President, Mahinda Rajapakse. The Hon Minister, Pavithra Wanniarachchi also stated that the present government is the only government who considered that, it is a basic Human right to provide electricity to the people.When I first took over the Ministry of Power and Energy the rule at that time was, even though there is electricity in the village, the public had to spend out of their pocket to install the power poles if they wish to get electricity for their homes. But I changed this rule. I took a practical decision that just as much electricity is given to the village, the onus to fix an electricity pole in front of the house, should be vested with the Ceylon Electricity Board.At that time Hon. President gave me the responsibility of providing electricity to all households by end of 2014. What we understood, when we went to the villages was that eventhough electricity had come to the village, it was difficult to get the electricity to the house from the pole, due to the poverty of our people. Some people did not have enough money even to get the wiring installed in their house. There was no body or no institution to lend them the money for this purpose. It was while looking for a solution for this problem that we came up with this idea to get the Electricity Board to bear the cost of wiring and the cost of installing the electricity Pole in front of the house and to recover this money, along with the electricity bill , in 72 monthly installments in 6 years, without any interest and thus providing electricity to the people.We should be grateful to our President for giving the necessary advice and guidance for this practical solution. We should be grateful to our President, who is like a loving father to our people.Electricity is a wonderful thing. Today every nook and corner of Sri Lanka has electricity. We will be able to supply 100% electricity by the end of this year to the country.Even in countries in this region, such as India, Nepal, Pakistan and China there is no 100% electricity supply. However the Hon. President gave me this target. When I told this to my officers they took all measures to achieve this target.Attending this occasion was Mr. Kanchana Jayaratne, Chairman of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, vice chairman of the Ceylon Electricity board Mr. KapilaPerera, General Manager of the CEB Mr. Shavindranath Fernando, and all Senior officials of the Ceylon Electricity Board and members of the Provincial and Pradesheeya Sabhas of the Ratnapura District.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3387", "title": "The sri lanka electricity board will no longer be an institution of debt"},

Bridges were guarded by security posts Every transformer was guarded by a policeman Water pipes became protected elementsEvery government had a higher priority in securing the engineering work rather than creating a conducive environment for its progression But today the scenario has changed.. The strong leadership of His Excellency the president Mahinda Rajapaksa has changed all that he swept away the terrorism from the face of the countryand did not stopped from there  then the government launched a rapid redevelopment programme that encouraged development in many sectors including construction, power & energy, textile , tea, export industries, and tourism among many others.In this background the engineers role became significant within the national development. The demand for engineering inputs increased and government also recognised the valuable contribution by engineers in development by providing a special allowance for all state employed engineers. I also consider its a remarkable situation that Minister of Economic Development Hon. Basil Rajapaksa being present on this occasion today. who was the pioneer in driving the redevelopment programme after achieving long awaited peace.Within this setting I perceive this award ceremony to felicitate the achievements in engineering profession as an integral component of this whole development process.

{"date": "12 Mar", "text": "A large force of energy can be created if electricity is saved little by little. A little effort of each individual ultimately contributes to produce a lot of power. We made a small request to switch off one bulb in the period 2011- 2012 when there was an energy crisis. If a bulb of 60-watt switched-off in five million houses, we are able to save 300 MW. That is equivalent to the power generated in the coal power plant in Puttalam. It is able to save a lot of energy when collective strength is added to a little effort.The minister expressed these views in a ceremony organized to deliver prizes and certificates for the schools and the children who were excelled in the energy tournament organized in 2012, under the Jana Viduli Balagara (power generation plants by people) concept with the objective of directing children towards conservation of power and energy. Twenty four schools in the country, and their children received the awards and certificates.Minister Ranawaka further said,The prize giving was not held even though this competition was held in the year 2012. It was a bad practice and a mistake of our political structure. Some institutions do not encourage continuing good practices but they are continuing with bad. I must be thankful to the Lanka Transformers Ltd., for reminding this good practice and coming forward to complete this endeavor as a duty towards our children.Racketeers of this country are waiting to take advantages from crisis situations to strengthen their pockets. We are proud of our school children who liberated the country from such a situation that time. Today, we are living in an era which is most vicious than before. People are creative. The first element of creativity is the language and communication. The second element is the ability of getting done his requirements from the environment. Sri Lanka is one of the worlds first countries which cultivated grain. Its one of the major creativity of our people. The third important element is the exchange. This is an important feature of man. Another thing of human creativity is the law. The most important thing of human creativity is the usage of energy instead of human and animal labor. Coconut oil was used in our country for that purpose. Other countries used animal fat for the same purpose.Today, we are able to do many things because of electricity. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas deposits are due to diminish in the near future. They will last maximum for another four decades more. After that the country will need to provide with alternative energy sources. The Sustainable Energy Authority is planning to adopt green energy policy. Major part of the energy requirement of Sri Lanka still fulfilled by fire- wood. It is not a symbol of under development. We have to grow our energy in the same way we grow our food. Energy Farming will become the most important industry in the next three decades.Improving efficiency is the most important thing in the world. We always thought about the demand, but not the management of energy. When increasing the demand we thought of building up more and more power stations but not the ways of saving energy. In Sri Lanka the demand for electricity increases by 4% to 3% per annum. If that percentage can be added back to the grid by the electricity savings of school children, it is not necessary to build new power plants. So we took a decision to move forward towards big savings campaign not only for electricity but also integrating fuel, gas and all allied areas.We have reduced the prices of fuel. We thought that because of this decreases the amount of money will save with people. But what really happened was the increase of travel because of the prices reduction. This is a bad habit of us. Fuel should be saved. Fuel wont last for a long time. Bangladesh is providing gas for free. Therefore people in Bangladesh have become lazy to turn off their gas stoves. The biggest problem faced by that government is the continuation of the provision of free gas. Because in another few years the gas deposits of Bangladesh are getting diminished. If they stopped free gas, the government will fall. Pakistan is having18-hour power cut by now. It had happened because the country is not an energy saver. Therefore it has to look for energy supply as well as energy savings. The country could face a kind of a situation which Bangladesh, Pakistan are facing if we are not adopting energy conservation system he said.Teachers and students of 24 schools along with senior officials of the Ministry of Power and Energy, Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon Electricity Company, and the Lanka transformer Ltd. were attended the event.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3758", "title": "People should become pioneers to carry forward the great national effort of energy saving"},

We also feel that this endeavour will develop a domestic gas market and diversify our energy mix and lowering our generation cost.It is also expected to increase the government revenue through taxes and royalty from the gas and oil deposits.There is a proposal to develop the Dorado field laying sub-sea facilities together with an onshore gas processing plant supported by a 55 km length 10 inch sub-sea pipe line to Norochcholai and from that point to erect a 150km onshore pipe line to Colombo in order to provide liquid fuel to 630 MW of CEB and private power plants and to other consumers.According to a recent calculation that over the past 250 years two trillion tons of CO2 waste from fossil fuel generation has been dumped into the atmosphere with one trillion tons dumped during the last 35 years!If energy usage doubles as predicted another two trillion tons will be dumped before 2050 because of this excessive emission, stipulated carbon budget may exceed. That is 450 ppm on a 2 degrees centigrade threshold. This will definitely result in many climate change issues with grave repercussions for all of us. Therefore, while achieving our desired economic growth and development targets it is our duty to be extra careful in preserving our precious natural environment. According to Stora report global economy will shrink by 5-10 % in 2100. It is envisaged Sri Lanka economy might shrink 1.2 % by 2050 and 6.5 % by 2100.A feasibility study is now been carried out to connect the Indian electricity grid and Sri Lankan electricity grid. This is from Madurai in India to Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka thereby transferring power both ways depending on the demand and supply.

Due to these factors and natural gas not found yet (though the indications are there) Mannar Basin gas production is not a priority for them.Cairn made known their stance on the Mannar Basin gas during talks with the government in Colombo last month, industry sources said.The quarterly financial report of the company which is expected to be out soon, is expected to give a clearer picture in this regard.\n", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3529", "title": "Sri Lankas planning of upstream petroleum development"},

{"date": "16 May", "text": "Those days we didnt have motor vehicles so we used to walk. Today we didnt have such difficulties. Today, people are having motor vehicles. At present 5.5 million families living in Sri Lanka and there are 6.0 million vehicles. In the past people were in the habit of going to sleep by 7 oclock in the night. But today people are not like that. Lives of people had been revolutionized due to the introduction of new energy sources. But the worlds oil reserves are close to exhaust. Thus our children have to live in a world without fossil oil.If we dont have a proper plan we will face big issues regarding the energy. Emission of carbon takes place due to the burn up of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and LP gas. The carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere around the earth. As a result, the global temperature goes up. It creates droughts, heavy rains, earthquakes as well as melting down of snow in the polar region. As a result of the melting snow, the level of sea goes up creating the sea erosion. If we dont try to stop this process by now, in another 200 years the human beings may become extinct.Therefore, in this environment day we must determine to enter into a process of protecting the entire ecosystem including the human being without limiting our efforts only to planting of trees and protecting of animals said Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the minister of power and energy at a commemoration program of the environment day held at Ananda College Colombo.Today, conservation of environment is a complex subject. We are thinking that environment gets protected when we protect and plant trees. But protecting environment is something more humanitarian things that extend beyond. Human being is different from other animals because of the creativity. There are about 8 million living species in the world. Human is only one of them. Human created a language and symbols to communicate. Today, the whole world had networked through it. The symbolic language invented in the caves had spread out throughout the world. This is a giant leap of the human being. Another important thing man has done was the finding of the food and the medicine required for themselves through the plants and trees of the forest. We Sri Lankans can be proud of being the first nation that started growing grains for living. The man who found food from the forest changed to eat grain and fruits cultivated by them. Another creation of mankind is the fire. The man who found fire had continued to invent many things. By today, they have created an energy driven world mainly through fossil fuels. We need 2060 Kilo Calories per day to live. But we are using 125 times energy a day by now.I request you to save energy in every household in this month of energy conservation. We are going to set off the electricity bill free if people saved 20% of their monthly electricity usage. Well give prized for the drivers who save fuel in their vehicles. At the same time while we conserve energy, the time has come to divert for other energy sources, he added.\n", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3718", "title": "Human being may become extinct in another 200 years if environment pollution has not been stopped"},

{"date": "25 May", "text": "The ministry of power and energy together with the Presidents office declared an energy conservation month from 15th May to 15th June. The launch was held under Presidents Patronage with a 4 KM walk. This project was another step of that energy conservation program.You are the people who are dedicated towards the national security and taking actions to ensure it. You are the people who fought the battle without thinking of your lives to re-gain the peace of the country. In this peaceful environment, you have a huge responsibility towards conservation of energy. Being a government entity and also being the SLArmy who have direct linkages to about three hundred thousand families you have a great job to be done.Main objective of this program is to raise some awareness on the conservation of energy and we expect you to become leaders and pioneers who are making efforts in implementing these practices in your establishments as well as at home.How can we manage energy in our houses and offices? Here we are discussing some important techniques, tactics, ways and means of energy conservation which we can use to conserve energy. Not only the electricity, but also a large number of motor vehicles are being used by the Armed forces. Therefore, we are also expecting to save fuel from your day today activities.Energy is usually physical in nature. If there is any change to be done in the real world context, what mainly required is energy. Energy is essential if we want to do something.There are different levels of energy. First well try to identify what the primary energy is? Primary energy can be used directly without any changes. As examples we can identify hydro power, solar power, wind power, energy of firewood, oil, coal and gas.When the primary energy is changed to the level which we can use for different applications, it is called secondary energy. Here we can take the exmple of electricity where we use it by turning on a switch. Ultimately, what is important for us is the services we are get out from it. We need to move vehicles, have to have light when it is dark, need to heat surroundings when it is cold and need to cool the environment when it is hot. Energy gets wasted when converting primary energy to secondary. Conservation of energy is the minimizing of this energy wastage.The biggest complain against us is the high cost of electricity comparing with the other countries in the region. But we have a speciality where other countries dont have. That is being the single country in the region where electricity is provided round the clock. Ans also we provide electricity to industry at a concessionary rate.When considering the influence to the world economy from fossil fuel, it is about 80% which happen through oil, coal and gas. By the year 2045-2055 world will face a scarcity of oil, coal and gas resources. At present, fifty percent of our total import cost is for coal and oil imports. Therefore, to reduce this level we have to use energy strategically. To face this situation we have to use walking for shorter distances and have to use public transport as much as we can. We have to use our own vehicles for essential purposes only. When driving motor vehicles we have to keep the speed level at 60-80 kmph and have to keep the air pressure of tyres at the optimum level. Vehicke should not keep at the start mode when it is not necessary. Use correct lubricants for your vehicles. By properly maintaining your vehicles you can save fuel and contribute to conserve energy.There are about 5.5 million households in Sri Lanka. If each household turned off a single light bulb which is not essential, we can save electricity which is sufficient to close down a power station. Reduce the usage of bulbs in between 6.30 PM to 9.30 PM. Try to turn-off at least one light bulb. Use a different time outside the peak power band 6.30 PM to 9.30 PM for ironing. Usually in households the highest number of units consumed for refrigiration. Place the refregirator where there is no direct sunlight. Minimize the time that keep the refrigirator door open. Repair if there is any leakage. Place windows enabling natural light to come in.Dont use old incandescent lamps for lighting. And also it can save a lot of energy by using energy efficient electrical utilities.In an office the main demand for electricity is for air conditioning. Therefore the temperature should be keep at 26 degrees centigrade. Regarding oil and electricity consumption also a little saving from a single family cumulatively becomes a lage national saving. Providing quality fuel is also one solution for improving energy conservation.Ceylon Electricity Board and Ceylon Petroleum Corporation are finding technological solutions by researches. Our main objective is to make the country self-sufficient from energy while directing the country towards green energy. When people are getting educated from this message like today, we expect that they will act towards saving energy he said.Minister of power and energy Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka said at an occasion held to educate army officers on energy management at the defense service college auditorium on May 25th.Lieutenant General A W J C De Silva commandar of the army, Mr.Padmasiri the director general of the sustainabele energy authority, Assistant director General Mr. Wimal Nadeera, Additional secretary to the ministry of power and energy Mr. Upali daranagama including senior officers of the Sri Lanka Army attended the programme.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3781", "title": "Minister of Power & Energy educates Army Officers on energy conservation"},

Petroleum Corporation cannot supply fuel to corrupted entities Sri Lankan Airlines and Mihin Air and getting the blame. At the sametime the era of paying taxes to the government by borrowed money from peoples bank and the Bank of Ceylon to set off government expenditure has passed. We are not paying taxes against the Petroleum Corporation act. Taxes need to be paid from your profits. Hereafter we are not allowing any politicians, kings or the corrupt people around the palace to depend from the compensation by corporation. said Mr.Patali Champika Ranawaka, the minister of power and electricity.He made these comments on an occasion held at the Sapugaskanda refinery 20th evening. This event had been organized to appraise employees who have worked for more than 30 years. Gold souvenirs were presented to those employees by the Minister Ranawaka. Then the minister observed the refinery process and the premises. Minister Ranawaka further expressing his views at the employee gathering said,Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is the biggest establishment with the government ownership with respect to the money that they handle. Annually this organization handles Rs. 400-500 billions. The next biggest is the Ceylon Electricity Board. Therefore, these two powerful entities along with the other entities attached to them are very important to this country economically and financially.When Sri Lanka was receiving the independence, a set of educated people had been appointed to take forward the activities in the energy sector. Mr. D.J Wimalasurendra was appointed to take care of electricity. After he was appointed to the parliament in 1936, he forwarded a special plan to build up a domestic electricity system. The Lakshapana power station had created as a result of that plan.The national plan which presented in 1952 emphasized the necessity of building up a oil refinery for Sri Lanka. We got this refinery as we have acted towards the objective without any political bias. But the refinery had not improved during the past era. This refinery supplies only 30% of the total requirement of the country. And also its efficiency is at a lower level.Recently a mid-term plan has been prepared for the electricity and energy sector. One important part of that plan is to bring the self sufficiency to the country through gas and fuel. Now there is a reliable sign from the Mannar basin of the availability of gas. Our expectation is to use the deposit in the future for the requirements of the country. We will take the necessary steps on next October to start excavations. Our expectation is to be self sifficient with energy as we have achieved from our paddy cultivation.We have to develop the oil sector in the country into a stable position. Some trade unions are protesting for their own popularity that there are frauds and corruptions in the petroleum corporation. They are further saying that the corporation is going to be sold out. I would like to say responsibly that in the future, we manage the petroleum corporation to a position without any financial loss. I have informed this to the director board, the cabinet and to the minister of finance.We know about the people who had spent billions of rupees of this corporation to purchase palaces in foreign countries. We have to put a fullstop to that era. At the sametime we know people who have deposited billions to their own accounts. We will purchase fuel in the future only through a tender procedure. Well say proudly, if there are corruptions and frauds well take stern actions to eliminate them. Two contracts out from every five contracts to supply fuel had been used to import fuel without tender practices. Other three tenders also carried with no- formalities. Therefore, I cancelled these five contracts with the approval of cabinet.Any institution under my purview had not fallen back until now. Instead they had developed. But there are people who are getting hurt from it. We know who the people behind moves of corruptions are. We are not getting discourage from their activities. I need the support of all employees without any political ideology to make this institution a strong, important, methodical,and a magnificent one.

We need to remember again and again that this country had protected the Buddha Sasana continuously for two thousand three hundred years. There is no such a religious history for any other country in the world.Finally, when we lost our country to foreign invaders, it was happened in this vicinity. At that time many patriotic people of the country had made great sacrifices to save our motherland with the blessings of the Sacred Tooth Relic. This land carries hard evidence for that. It is a great responsibility of the nation to create a suitable environment for the location that suits our national heritage as well as the spirituality of this place.We are grateful to the Ceylon Electricity Board for the formalization and rearrangement of the electricity systems in this place. And we will be thankful to the Lanka Transformers limited for the re-arrangement of the internal electrical system of this temple of tooth relic.In 2012 when the country encountered a severe drought, we had the blessings and protection of sacred tooth relic.

Otherwise there should be enough resources in the country to come out from this indebtedness. The only solution available today to overcome this situation is the utilization of unattended oil and gas resources in the ocean,Eventhough we received these resources in the near future, the country may not be developed as we expect. Nigeria become poor and Norway become rich after they found the oil resources in their countries. Therefore, we have to use these resources mindfully. The processes should be well acceptable both environmentally as well as socially.

The official circular regarding the Energy Conservation school program and the establishment of energy clubs in schools was due to issue with the assistance of the ministry of Education.The minister speaking at the ceremony said,We need different energy sources for our day to day living. By today our country as well as the whole world has faced an energy problem. From one side energy is scarce. Oil, coal and gas deposits are expected to finish by four decades by now.Our children will have to live in a world without oil, coal, and gas in another 4 decades. On this new situation the world will tend to standstill. We must prepare our country to face this situation.Thatswhy we are carrying out this energy conservation program.Carbon emits when burning fossil fuel.This is a reason of increasing trmperature in the atmosphere. Today people on earth have to suffer a lot due to environmental issues.When people are suffering from high temperature at one side; people are dying because of cold in another side of the earth. Flooding in one side while people are dying due to droughts in the other side.In another side people are dying due to severe earthquakes. All these are not natural incidents. Some disasters are happening due to the burning of fossil fuels. Protecting the environment is not merely ptotecting trees. The broad picture behind that has to be understood. It is important to handover the natural environment including the occean, the earth and the atmosphere to our children as we received them from our ancestors.Through the new program initiated today, by switching off a single light bulb or controlling the energy usage of any other electric applience at your home , you are not only saving money but also you are doing your duty to the environment. It is also a service you offer to humanity as well as towards the world.As a nation which practice less use of resources, we must also launch this program in our houses and schools. We must dedicate ourselves towards conservating fuel and to create a new meaning to our lives. You all can contribute towards building our future with greenery by contributing to this national effort.

At the moment the target had been successfully achieved. Now there is no more ideas about implementing power cuts.We were able to purchase a unit of electricity at Rs.17 from the Uthuru Janani diesel power plant instead of spending Rs.30 per unit as the previous government did by purchasing electricity from other diesel power stations.By today, the Ceylon Electricity Board had become a financilly independent entity. And it is operating profitably. The previous rule offered Rs.3600 millions per year to continue the operations of diesel power plants. A set of racketeers established due to this huge transactions of money.

In the future Jaffna and Puttlan will become powerful stations for wind power.Inthe future additional fuel storage will be constructed in Jaffna. Before finding the oil resources the Norway was a poor country. But after findingout fossil gas Norway developed to one of the richest countries of the world. Now the future of the people of Norway is secure for another three centuries.But African countries like Nigeria became bad to worse when they found their oil resources.Comparing the situations, people in Sri Lanka have to decide that which state we would achieve. Hence they should select politicians who are doing a proper service to the society. If we look back we can see the past with fights and blood sheds where we lost everything. Therefore, without stepping into that grim past, people have to get a correct and a wise decision to move forward, he said.The state minister of power and energy Mr.Palitha range Bandara,The governer of the Northen province, Mr.Anura Wijepala ,the chairman of CEB, Mr.Priyantha Goonathilaka DGM (North) of CEB along with many officials of state institutions participated the occasion.\n", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=3957", "title": "Mannar bay will become the centre of economy of Sri Lanka in the next 10 years"},

But to speak about the future with the same proudness, we must built our present based on the spiritual power of our ancestors. The minister of power and energy Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka said at the centenary of the Captain Edward Henry Pedris execution at the hands of the colonial administration during the 1915 Sinhala-Muslim riots in Ceylon. The commemoration was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.The biography of Captain Henry Pedris which were written in both Sinhala and English languages were launched at this occasion.Minister Ranawaka noted that today, Sri Lanka has got a valuable opportunity to successfully move forward towards a developed future. When taking social indices the country is at a better position compare with the other countries of the world especially in the region. In our county the life expectancy of a person at the birth had reached to 80 years. We must be happy about it. It is an equal status of a 1st world nation. And also our literacy rate is at a higher level about 98 percent. It is the highest in our region. When consider the education it is higher than any country of our region. Today, the female ratio of the university had become 62 percent as Sri Lanka is one of the Buddhist countries. Developed countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have not yet achieved that level.Today, our country had achieved infrastructure development. At present, there are 5.5 million families in the country. Ninety eight percent of those families are having electricity for their houses. Every family will get electricity by the end of this year. Earlier the electricity was a luxury which enjoyed by a limited number of families. Today, there is a telephone at every house. Every child knows how to use a computer. If the physical things are developing at this rate, we must also develop the political environment accordingly that suit for this situation. It should be a knowledge, honesty, justice and equality. Fulfilling that task is the best honor that we can offer to the national hero, Capt. Henry Pedris. We are having the potential of being the strongest and the super country of this region. Today we are having the opportunity of getting self sufficient from food, drugs, and the fuel. Today, we have found oil and gas deposits from the North Western province of this country.

The new concept of Good Governance through Compromises and Consensus has to extend to the village level too.Electricity is crucial for the development of the country. Depending on the fossil fuels to generate electricity is a huge set back. Now it is the time to move towards renewable energy sources to generate electricity. The contribution for the generation of electricity from the renewable energy sources should increase up to 50% by the year 2020. At the same time steps have to be taken to minimize the waste of elecricity energy. The waste of electricity which is about 11% in 2015 has to be minimized to 8% by 2020. By minimizing this waste of electricity, the demand can be reduced by 2%.There are about 20,000 employees working in the Sri Lanka Electricity Board by now.

Therefore, it is an important task to commomorate such a character.Our target is to extend our abilities and skills to the international level.You may have new plans to be implemented but there may have fewer opportunities to communicate them. Usually when new ideas are being expressed to ministers, they accept them but there is no progress afterwards. However I am ready and prepared to convey your ideas to the government and to the cabinet and to create more Wimalasurendras out from yourselves.It is very important to have the cohesion as a group from the minister to the employee who works in the light post of the remote village.

{"date": "16 Sep", "text": "Today, few of our brothers in Ceylon Electricity Board are striking. They had charged many allegations. Putting full-stop to fraud and misappropriation in Ceylon Electricity Board is one of them. In fact, I can tell our brothers with a responsibility that my term is the era where fraud and misappropriation in CEB have come down. We are procuring everything through competitive bids. We are doing so is to reduce frauds, and that is our aim. For example: in an urgent situation, if minister wants, he has authority to purchase electricity first and later can inform it to the Cabinet of Ministers. However, all the times what I have done is that I took steps to purchase electricity through calling bids internationally. So far, we have purchased solar power and wind power at competitive price and thereby we have reduced their price from Rs.23.00 up to Rs.12.00 and Rs.11.00 respectively. There may be problems. We have to find solutions for them. But, I can tell with a responsibility that my term is the era where fraud and misappropriation in CEB have come down.The second allegation is the matter that the money of the Employees Provident Fund was misused. I took action in this regard. This had taken place during 2008  2009. I initiated inquires based on the first information I received. The Criminal Investigation Department carried out inquiries. A criminal case also was filed. Not only that but also an inquiry was conducted in the ministry, and an internal audit inquiry too was held. Apart from these, a civil case also was filed. Central Bank of Sri Lanka has already agreed to return part of that money to us. If we receive that half of money, we have option to get the rest of it by having discussion or even by filing a case. In my era only, actions were taken to get that money back and bring culprits before the law.Third is the increase of electricity bill which they talk about. This is the era where Ceylon Electricity Board faced a lot of financial crisis. It happened not with any ones fault. We should have increased the electricity bill in that time, but we have passed it. There are climate changes which we are facing very often. We have experienced an acute drought after 30 years. As a country providing 100% electricity, that is why we estimated at the beginning of this year that an additional cost would incur for fuels in order to maintain continuous power supply without hindrance. I informed this to the Cabinet of Ministers and explained that we never need to increase the electricity bill as an alternative remedy.Cabinet of Ministers has accepted this as a risk management fund. Both His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister extended their support to receive additional funds from the Treasury to cover this sort of additional cost. 6 billion rupees has already been provided by the Treasury. Therefore, we have passed the time when we wanted to increase the electricity bill. This is the first time where cost incurred without receiving funds from the Treasury and without putting burden on the public.Next matter is the issue to stop the service of NVQ employees in Ceylon Electricity Board which is spoken by them now. There were about 7000 employees who had not been absorbed into permanent service. They have now been absorbed into permanent cadre. Now, NVQ employees are recruited as trainees. Now they have a good opportunity to join the permanent service of Ceylon Electricity Board with their technical knowledge given to them to ensure quality and profession of Ceylon Electricity Board, and they can get into permanent cadre by submitting their certificates at the time of their appointments.Other important issue is the salary anomalies which are spoken by them. This happened in 2014, and now they are talking about it. This is a very complicated issue. Because, one group says that salary should not be increased in any way as a remedy to solve such salary irregularities. Other group says no that their salary should be increase. Two groups are with different views and dragging each other. We had negotiations with all these groups. We appointed a committee under the Secretary to the Ministry. We gave opportunity to every trade union to have discussion on their issues in a very appropriate democratic way of finding solutions, and to implement the decision to be given by that of committee. In this favorable environment, they unfortunately initiated strike.We have a responsibility. We have provided 5.5 millions of people with electricity. It is our responsibility to protect the needs of all those people. I kindly appeal all these brothers to protect the good name of CEB. Please report to work. We are always prepared to find solutions through negotiations. People have recognized us as a group who takes decision based on negotiations. Therefore, we do not allow any inconvenient to cause even single consumer of this country. Please see every problem in a practical way. Two groups are in two sides and blindly talking. Then, how can we reach a neutral decision. It is difficult. So, I appeal all be cooperating and helpful to find a good solution for this matter in dispute.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=4710", "title": "Report to work forthwith without putting the public in trouble.

We have a problem. Today, there is a gap between education and needs of the country. We have provided job opportunities for one hundred thousand graduates. Today there are equal number of graduates as which stood 5 years ago. To prevail these things, there must be a big gap between education and countrys needs. There is no rule that all sectors of education should ultimately end with employments. If it is so, the world would not move towards. There must be multi-sectors like arts and orations. If there is a sector of education with job opportunities for all, this existing benefit would not come. Many countries of the world have elevated their educational status to the required standard. There is no need of waiting for jobs in queue and no need to form associations of un-employed graduates. We have to move our children towards technology which is the only fact that should be done in our country. This is a good possible decision which was taken in those days. This is not a simple task. This is a task which should be jointly done by all of us by changing government policy. This has become as an initiative to draw attraction of famous schools and as well as to provide technology for the children and the country. Technical laboratory facilities are given to the schools which are not famous. Law cannot be changed. Two aspirations are here.

We will implement a plan of identifying future management leaders for the state sector at school level, and mould them into efficient personnel. I am pleased that the power and energy sector has been able to be part of this initiative, he said.Also speaking on the occasion the minister of youth and skills development Dallas Alahapperuma said that it had taken around 100 years for the technical field to reach the rural areas. Although the first technical collage was esdtablished in the country in 1893, these technical schools reached the villages only in 1996.

The principle of the school handed over a development project report of the school to the visiting ambassador.Addressing the gathering minister Ranawaka said that today our country is making great strides in the academic field. In the past only those of the affluent class had the privilege of education. However no matter what peoples perceptions or opinions are, the country had reached these greats heights solely due to the free education system. Therefore all governments should endeavour to develop education further. Korea used to be a very backward country in many areas. Around 1950 to 60 Koreas  personal income was 1/3rd of Sri Lankas. However today it is twelve times more than ours. Today the industries in Korea are booming, and our youth are lining up seeking employment there. Hence we can learn so much from that country in the way they have achieved prosperity.However the minister pointed out that in spite of the massive technical development taking place, Korea only had around 15% of land for cultivation purposes.

Last year the daily power generation capacity stood at between 1900 to 2100 MW. From then to now 250,000 new subscribers have been added to the consumer list. However it is praiseworthy that in spite of the additional number of consumers, the daily power consumption had remained at 1950 MW. It was due to the committed staff of the CEB and the conservation efforts of the general public that this feat has been accomplished, said Minister Ranawaka.The minister visited the Kegalle district today (13) with a consumer base of around 100,000 in order to declare open several consumer services centres and electrical engineers offices for the convenience of the general public.Accordingly a consumer service centre built by the CEB at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million in the Morontota area targeting a consumer base of around 11,000 in the Kegalle district was declared open by the minister. Meanwhile the consumer service centre operated thus far under minimal facilities was also renovated at a cost of Rs. 2.5 million for the convenience of around 8000 consumers in the Kegalle district. The electrical engineers office in the Mawanella area at a cost of Rs. 3.5 million for the benefit of around 50,000 consumers and the Hemmanagama consumer service centre built at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million benefiting around 6000 families in the area was declared open by the minister.Addressing the gathering the minister said that the power and energy ministry has spend double the samurdhi funds as power concessions.

He said that Sri Lanka is one of the only countries in the region that has provided electricity supply round the clock to over 92% of its population, and also the lowest tariff rates for electricity. He made these statements at an energy conservation seminar at the Finance ministry on Tuesday (15).The minister added that in Tamil Nadu low income families using less that 30 units of power, have to pay Rs. 5.62 per unit (in Sri Lankan currency), while in Sri Lanka inclusive of the fuel surcharge we have to pay only Rs. 5.00 per unit.In Chennai they impose a daily power cut of two hours, while in rural areas power cuts are experienced for between 08  12 hours, while industries have to close for two days a week. He said that in comparison industrialists and domestic consumers in Sri Lanka enjoy electricity round the clock.Last year The CEB had provided electricity concessions of Rs. 17 Billion to low income families and 07 billion for industrialists totaling Rs. 24 billion. This he said was over the total Rs. 17 billion operational loss.He added that efforts to construct a coal power station since 1988 was postponed until 2006 due to political wrangling, and said that both power stations that generate electricity at low cost namely Lakwijaya in Puttlam and the Upper Kothmale power plant were both constructed during the tenure of president Rajapaksa.He further added that it is a joke that the same people that refrained from constructing power stations and opted to purchase power from private sources at exorbitant rates, while imposing seven hour power cuts daily, are the ones talking about power bills today.The minister said that it was the UNP regime that increased the electricity rates by 21% ( from 17 cents to Rs. 03.76) during their tenure between 1977  1994 having hydro power capabilities.He said that therefore it is a total lie that Sri Lanka has the highest charges for electricity. On the contrary Sri Lanka is better than the countries that use nuclear power, those using low quality coal and countries that have oil reserves.The minister added that currently due to the lack of rains almost 77% of power requirement is generated through thermal sources, while adding that by 2014 when the total construction of the coal power plant is completed this situation will be sorted out.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=2033", "title": "Minister Ranawaka says Allegations that Sri Lanka has the highest electricity charges is totally false."},

The world has been looking for economic development throughout the past period and different areas like technology, information management, etc. have attained far reaching goals. For this economic development, energy is one of the major resources used for which the major source is fossil fuel. Extensive use of fossil fuel in the way we do right now, has led to energy and environmental crises faced by mankind. On the one side, there is a rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources. On the other side the burning of fossil fuel results in environmental issues. Therefore, the focus of the entire world has been set towards the sustainability in the energy sector, and apart from the long-term energy sustainability, obviously it is necessary that we do have more sustainable solutions for energy in the short-term horizon as well.On the Invitation of the SAARC Power and Energy Center, on the instructions of the Ministry of power and Energy, a four day workshop on Power and energy conservation was organized by the Renewable Energy Authority with the participation of 6 countries at the Colombo Intercontinental Hotel with the patronage of the Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka this morning.

{"date": "01 May", "text": "Let me first thank you for the keen interest in participating this all important event, which I am sure all of you will benefit and will get a good insight about not only the concept of Balanc Score Card but also about the future operational strategy of the CEB.At the outset I would like to emphasis that as government owned entities we used to measure and evaluate only financial indicators and this was the primary criteria in gauging the successfulness of our organizations. But, in addition to the financial perspective there are three additional perspectives, namely Customers, Employee Learning & Growth and Internal Business Process. As a whole we need to strike a right balance between these four vital elements. This balancing act will be done by the process called the Balanced Score Card System.Balanced Score Card System is a strategic planning and management tool which can be used in an organization to align and focus our activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, to improve internal and external communications, and to monitor organization performance against strategic goals. This will help us to add non-financial measures to financial measures which will reflect a more balanced perspective of our organization. I must also stress that this is not a tool to measure any individual performances but to measure the overall strategy of the organization with necessary corrective indicators. Measuring individual performances for personal appraisal will be an entirely different methodology and perhaps if we succeed in achieving the desired results we might have to extend this process for individual performance appraisals.This may be the first time in a government organization in Sri Lanka, to start such a process and I wish CEB can take the lead and show the rest of the institutions the way forward.Having said that, I am of the opinion that CEB is a well-managed organization when compared to most of our state owned entities, but I would like to emphasis that we could do a lot better especially related to customer satisfaction, to be more productive, to stream line our internal structure and activities to clearly reflect organizational goals and objectives. This will help us to be at the forefront of well managed institutions in our country even above the private sector.Dear friends, we should clearly address the problem of not truly representing the internal structure of the CEB with a well-managed balanced Score Card system. We must extend this process taking into account the socio economic benefits of our activities and those parameters should also be internalize to create a right balance. For an example we can measure the incremental increase in land prices, impact on having uninterrupted electricity throughout 24 hours, measuring the quality of our power supply to our customers, etc. If we add other external parameters like socio-economic benefits created by the CEB we would be able to calculate the total profits rather than direct financial profits. The principle of Corporate Shared Value could guide us to achieve this.How do we identify these internal and external factors and create a strategic approach to meet our goals and objectives. In this scenario I believe that problem lies within us, which remain trapped in an outdated approach to value creation that has emerged over the past few decades.We continue to view value creation narrowly, trying to optimize financial performance but might be missing the most important customer needs and wants. We should take the lead in bringing our business and society more closer and create a new model of our own. We should also look for the principle of shared value, which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges.According to the Harvard Business Review,The concept of shared value can be defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progressUnquoteHaving said that let me also speak a few words about why we should go for green energy. The renewable energy sources are, in abundance in nature, are, at first, more expensive and difficult to draw on, but priced properly, will be cheap, reliable and clean. In addition with consequences of climate change, which I am confident we are now experiencing to a certain extent, there is no choice for us, but to start moving towards cleaner and greener energy sources in the future.On this perspective we not only as a nation but also as the whole world are now meeting the challenges of climate with greener technology on a grand scale. Please look into the things now happening in the world especially related to the oil and gas, there will be more chaos in future and prices of oil, gas and coal will increase and by 2030 there will not be sufficient and economical energy sources for countries like us. Therefore, we should prepare our plans now and look forward for greener and safer energy sources.I am positive that Balanced Score Card if properly implemented will be a strategic planning and management tool which will not only measure our individual performances against the organizational objectives but also will help us to identify what should be done and measured. This will help the senior managers like you to truly execute your strategies.What is imperative is, as professionals, we strive for the unfettered mind and the truth. As professionals we intend to defend the independent professional judgment against the subjective irrational opinion of the ordinary.Besides, our country won this unity through the great sacrifices and sufferings of many. It is now time for the great reconciliation and the building of a prosperous nation. Just like building the nation in a psychological sense, building the nation in the physical sense is also important. It is the duty of professionals like you to take the lead in both spheres of activity.I sincerely wish that todays conference will be able to contribute to the progress of our organization.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=2452", "title": "For the first time in the State Sector CEB Going for Balance score card System"},

{"date": "11 Mar", "text": "Addressing the Media briefing announcing the CEB 2010 Financial progress yesterday, Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka stated that after 10 years the CEB has been able to show a Rs. 5 billion profit. Emphasizing that Avoiding the Rs. 40 billion debt which the CEB anticipated from the beginning of 2010, it was possible to avoid taxing the people the additional Rs. 2000 irrespective of social status. Thus it is considered a victory for the people more than an achievement for the CEB.Furthermore He stated that whatever purchases the CEB had made in the 2010 financial year, subsequent to all dues settled in full the CEB was able to record a profit of Rs. 5 billion. Hence for the first time in history, during the year 2010 the CEB has been able to settle all dues payable to the Petroleum Corporation within the year.Several media organizations were of the opinion that the Petroleum Corporation was incurring losses due to the payments due by the CEB. They expressed that due to the CEB purchasing Heavy Fuel at Rs. 4o per liter from the Petroleum Corporation where the actual cost is Rs. 81, resulting in a 50% loss for the Petroleum Corporation. But the CEB has up to the 31st of August 2010 purchased Heavy Fuel from the Petroleum Corporation for a mere Rs. 26. Upon the request of the Petroleum Corporation discussions were held and the amount was increased to Rs. 40 per liter. This decision was reached with the intervention of the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore the purchase of Diesel will be carried out according to the normal market rate; NAPTA purchases it for Rs. 42.In the production process of Petroleum, Heavy Fuel remains as a residual product after the purification process of Diesel and Petrol. It is 38% of the entire process. The remnant Heavy Fuel percentage is far greater than all petroleum products. As a solution to this the CEB has set up thermal power stations such as Sapugaskanda. A major factor was that the Petroleum Corporation agreed to supply the Heavy Fuel which the Petroleum Corporation had no use for, free of Charge to the CEB. Therefore it is obvious that the Petroleum Corporation is not incurring losses due to the supply of Heavy Fuel free of charge, but rather due to long standing problems in the purification process.Prior to 2009.12.31 the dues owed which was Rs. 52 billion to the Petroleum Corporation by the CEB, the Treasury covered the cost without burdening both the CEB and the Petroleum Corporation.Accordingly I further reiterate that according to the Financial Progress report published by us yesterday (2011.03.10), the CEB has recorded a Rs. 05 billion for the financial year 2010.There are certain unscrupulous elements spreading false rumors with the sole intention of defaming and disrupting the Government and ministers.

{"date": "01 Jun", "text": "The main challenge facing the CEB management by September 2011 was the supply of power during the first six months of this year. There were two options that were considered. Going in for an additional 100 MW supplementary power or resort to power conservation methods. Going in for supplementary power would add on an additional burden of Rs. 13,000 to 17,000. Hence the CEB and the ministry of power and energy came up with the bold plan of efficient energy management instead of constantly resorting to supplementary power sources.Therefore focusing on power conservation the minister said that the current power conservation drive has proved to be a great success in efficient energy management.Taking all these issues into consideration, we decided to take a bold stance in attempting to manage the demand instead of looking for supplementary means of power. We launched a program in February at the BMICH in February with the aim of efficiently managing the power capacity that we already possess. We launched this program to better manage the 6000 MW capacity that we have. Then we began managing the household electricity consumption. This was a bit of an arduous task as the fuel prices were also increased. In comparison to 2010 the fuel costs have doubled. In 2010 our generation cost was Rs. 82 billion which sky rocketed to Rs. 163 billion by 2012, but the tariff remained the same. However the consumers eventually had to pay a fuel surcharge in order to compensate for the increase in fuel prices. Hence there was a 23% increase per unit charge on the fuel bills. Some had to stomach an increase of around 30%, to 40%. The unit charge that was at Rs. 13.00 increased to Rs. 16.00 with the addition of the surcharge. This increase too was a great burden on the people. These were the main factors that prompted us to pursue better energy management methods that would provide some consolation to the consumers.A special program was launched on 01 April, in line with the power conservation drive Today for tomorrow under the purview of the ministry of power and energy, where over 4.6 million consumers could win concessions on their electricity bills.Consumers, who show a reduction of 20% in their electricity bills in comparison to the March 2012 bill, will gain full exemption of that months electricity bill. Those consumers who show a reduction of 10% of their electricity bill could enjoy 50% off their electricity bills. All electricity consumers are eligible to register for this scheme. Consumers must show a reduction in their April, May or June bills in order to receive the concessions, or total exemption of the months electricity bill.Accordingly 1000 consumers who show a 20% reduction in their electricity bills will have a months electricity bill written off by either CEB or LECO. Similarly 5000 consumers who show a 10% reduction in their electricity bills will receive a 50% reduction on a months electricity bill.Hence 1000 persons who had reduced 20% of their electricity bill value in relation to the month of March were chosen to receive a month free electricity.Hence 25 of those chosen were symbolically awarded their token rewards at a ceremony held at the BMICH on 31 May.", "url": "http://powermin.gov.lk/english/?p=2012", "title": "1000 who conserved power were awarded free electricity"},

With the breakdown at the Lakwijaya coal power plant 300 MW has been deprived, while another 100 MW is deprived due to the breakdown at the Kerawalapitiya thermal power plant.Due to the consecutive failure in the monsoon rains that feed the reservoirs the country is forced to depend on thermal power to meet the countrys power requirement. Although the water levels in the reservoirs should be at 35% capacity, today due to the lack of rains it has reduced to 15%. The cost per unit of electricity when generated through thermal power increases ten folds in comparison to power generation through hydro power. Therefore the power network was controlled mainly by the Lakwijaya and Kerawalapitiya west coast power stations.On 02 July the west coast power stations operations stalled due to a technical problem, depriving the power sector of 270 MW.

Even when plans were drawn for the implementation of coal power stations, they were sabotaged by staging protests. Even the cabinet approvals in that regard were cancelled. These are the people who are now voicing their openions about the power and energy sector in this country, said the minister of power and energy Patali Champika Ranawaka.When the decision was made to construct the Norochcholai power station in 2005, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was also in the cabinet, and it was with their approval that the decision to construct this power station was taken, said the minister.The minister raised the question as to how the JVP are now questioning the very project that they were also part of approving. The minister stated that the present government has acted in a more responsible manner in all investments made in the power and energy sector, and instead of allowing the vultures destroy the countrys resources many wise investments have been made. He stated that due to the far thinking strategies of the government and the power and energy sector, 1.9 million electricity consumers have been convinced into contributing to the power conservation effort of the country.The minister made these comments during a press conference held yesterday (12) at the ministry auditorium.The minister admitting that a problem had arisen at the Lakwijaya power station on 08 August said that however they did not allow that issue to affect the industrial sector, nor the students facing the Advanced Level examinations. He said that the Lakwijaya power station was back in operation by 07 September.He pointed out that breakdowns were inevitable in any power generating facility. However the effect of the issue was mostly felt due to the dwindling hydro power generation capacity, which was the result of the failed consecutive monsoons. This situation arose for the first time in history. Even though many question us as to why we cannot follow the same actions as in 1996. The factor that many fail to see is that at the time the energy demand was just  of what it is today. However at the time we experienced 7 hour power cuts, and in addition power was obtained from external sources for higher rates, which also has contributed to the current crisis.However the minister pointed out that instead of curtailing the supply of electricity, the current administration developed the strategy of encouraging the people toward power conservation. Concurrent to the May, June and July today for tomorrow energy conservation drive, 1.9 million out of the total 4.2 million electricity consumers have contributed toward energy conservation. This is an excellent example of the collective effort of the people and the power sector. By the conservation of energy we have managed to save 84 GWH of electricity and also saved a colossal Rs. 4.33 billion.

Addressing the gathering the minister said that the government after having freed the people from the clutches of terrorism, is in the process of creating a better life for the people by providing all infrastructure facilities.He added that the Trincomalee district has reached 80% electrification at present. He pledged that by the end of the year the balance 20% would also be achieved. He also promised the people that two major electrification projects will be initiated in the Trincomalee district in the near future. The minister said that the people of these areas had suffered for many years due to the scourge of terrorism, but the people can now look forward to a better future, where Trincomalee will be developed into the countrys fourth industrial zone.Initially plans were afoot to provide electricity coverage to the entire country by the year 2017, however we expedited the program enabling the task to be accomplished by the end of this year. It costs the government several lakhs to provide electricity to every single household. However we only charge the consumer a very minimal amount while relaxing the obstacles that earlier prevented many from obtaining electricity connections. Through the Samurdi loan scheme people who were unable to afford electricity connections have been afforded that opportunity by providing them Rs. 30,000 in loans. Furthermore the rules have also been relaxed, where people can obtain an electricity connection only after a year of establishing their residency, added minister Ranawaka.He also pointed out that currently we are faced with temporary electricity related problems due to the changing weather patterns. Therefore we appeal to the general public to assist in the national energy conservation drive and be the recipients of uninterrupted electricity supply.
