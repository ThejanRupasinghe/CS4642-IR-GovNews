With this decision the electricity board will be able to save Rs. 3000-5000 millions which had been paid for the owners as capacity prices.\u201d the minister insisted.

With this closure the amount that is paying as the capacity charge can be saved.", "Minister Ranawaka further said,", "\u201cBecause of the electricity conserving methods we adopted in 2012, the necessity to build up large scale power plants has been ceased.

But with this conservation process now we need only 2300 MW in the night time.", "That means 85% of people had been changed to CFL and LED lighting for their domestic lighting purposes. If it has not happened, by now it has to build up more diesel power stations to meet the electricity demand. If the demand continued as forecasted, we would never be able to allow these thermal power plants to retire.", "Recently, I made a request to the cabinet to stop 5 tenders which had been supplied fuel to the petroleum corporation without the required formalities. The cabinet granted the permission. The very next day propaganda was launched saying that there would be a shortage of fuel as well as a price hike of oil in the near future. This is how the things happening in this country. \u00a0We would not give up our efforts towards safeguarding the energy sector with any of these influences. We are initiating the energy conservation process with a steady step of closing down thermal power stations. We expect your fullest cooperation to carry out this process\u201d.

It wouldn\u2019t be an issue if the Coal Power Plant Puttalam and other power plants were operational by that time. The hydro power capacity was dwindled at the end of 2011 and 2012 due to weak monsoon rains. Hence we had to face a crisis situation. There were several plans to arrest the situation. One is implementing a power cut. The other countries of the region are already using power cuts. When the electricity supply cannot meet the demand those countries are not supplying electricity round the clock for 24 hours. However, during that period if power cuts were implemented, it would have become a huge social problem. The second solution was to buy electricity from the private sector in the short-term basis.

In Sri Lanka the demand for electricity increases by 4% to 3% per annum. If that percentage can be added back to the grid by the electricity savings of school children, it is not necessary to build new power plants.

The biggest problem faced by that government is the continuation of the provision of free gas. Because in another few years the gas deposits of Bangladesh are getting diminished. If they stopped free gas, the government will fall. Pakistan is having18-hour power cut by now. It had happened because the country is not an energy saver.

Accordingly you not only save your own money but also contribute to the progress of the country\u2019s power and energy sector progress as well.", "The Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka made these comments addressing the staff of the Bank of Ceylon Headquarters at a workshop on the topic of\u00a0 \u201cconservation of power\u201d", "This workshop was organized by the Renewable Energy Authority with the aim of reducing the cost of electricity bills.

But, in addition to the financial perspective there are three additional perspectives, namely Customers, Employee Learning & Growth and Internal Business Process. As a whole we need to strike a right balance between these four vital elements. This balancing act will be done by the process called the Balanced Score Card System.", "Balanced Score Card System is a strategic planning and management tool which can be used in an organization to align and focus our activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, to improve internal and external communications, and to monitor organization performance against strategic goals. This will help us to add non-financial measures to financial measures which will reflect a more balanced perspective of our organization. I must also stress that this is not a tool to measure any individual performances but to measure the overall strategy of the organization with necessary corrective indicators. Measuring individual performances for personal appraisal will be an entirely different methodology and perhaps if we succeed in achieving the desired results we might have to extend this process for individual performance appraisals.", "This may be the first time in a government organization in Sri Lanka, to start such a process and I wish CEB can take the lead and show the rest of the institutions the way forward.", "Having said that, I am of the opinion that CEB is a well-managed organization when compared to most of our state owned entities, but I would like to emphasis that we could do a lot better especially related to customer satisfaction, to be more productive, to stream line our internal structure and activities to clearly reflect organizational goals and objectives. This will help us to be at the forefront of well managed institutions in our country even above the private sector.", "Dear friends, we should clearly address the problem of not truly representing the internal structure of the CEB with a well-managed balanced Score Card system. We must extend this process taking into account the socio economic benefits of our activities and those parameters should also be internalize to create a right balance. For an example we can measure the incremental increase in land prices, impact on having uninterrupted electricity throughout 24 hours, measuring the quality of our power supply to our customers, etc. If we add other external parameters like socio-economic benefits created by the CEB we would be able to calculate the total profits rather than direct financial profits. The principle of Corporate Shared Value could guide us to achieve this.", "How do we identify these internal and external factors and create a strategic approach to meet our goals and objectives. In this scenario I believe that problem lies within us, which remain trapped in an outdated approach to value creation that has emerged over the past few decades.", "We continue to view value creation narrowly, trying to optimize financial performance but might be missing the most important customer needs and wants. We should take the lead in bringing our business and society more closer and create a new model of our own. We should also look for the principle of shared value, which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges.", "According to the Harvard Business Review,", "The concept of shared value can be defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Shared value creation focuses on identifying and expanding the connections between societal and economic progress", "Unquote", "Having said that let me also speak a few words about why we should go for green energy. The renewable energy sources are, in abundance in nature, are, at first, more expensive and difficult to draw on, but priced properly, will be cheap, reliable and clean. In addition with consequences of climate change, which I am confident we are now experiencing to a certain extent, there is no choice for us, but to start moving towards cleaner and greener energy sources in the future.", "On this perspective we not only as a nation but also as the whole world are now meeting the challenges of climate with greener technology on a grand scale. \u00a0Please look into the things now happening in the world especially related to the oil and gas, there will be more chaos in future and prices of oil, gas and coal will increase and by 2030 there will not be sufficient and economical energy sources for countries like us.\u00a0 Therefore, we should prepare our plans now and look forward for greener and safer energy sources.", "I am positive that Balanced Score Card if properly implemented will be a strategic planning and management tool which will not only measure our individual performances against the organizational objectives but also will help us to identify what should be done and measured. This will help the senior managers like you to truly execute your strategies.What is imperative is, as professionals, we strive for the unfettered mind and the truth. As professionals we intend to defend the independent professional judgment against the subjective irrational opinion of the ordinary.", "Besides, our country won this unity through the great sacrifices and sufferings of many. It is now time for the great reconciliation and the building of a prosperous nation. Just like building the nation in a psychological sense, building the nation in the physical sense is also important. It is the duty of professionals like you to take the lead in both spheres of activity.", "I sincerely wish that today\u2019s conference will be able to contribute to the progress of our organization."]},
