Rs 2 billion of that amount are for business entities. We had asked you to pay this money as soon as possible. The District Secretaries have informed that they approved and sent all the money needed.

However, it still requires consistent and concerted efforts to challenge and change attitudes and behaviours that normalize and reinforce violence against women. I'm really grateful that Mahela and Kumar have been willing to give their time to highlight that this sort of behaviour is completely unacceptable.

Prevention of violence against women and girls starts with better educating and informing children in schools.

Any changes of the term of President would be an alienation of the sovereignty of the people, Attorney General Presidents Counsel Jayantha Jayasuriya said.There is no provisions in the 19th Amendment to operate same with retrospective effect. Constitutions cannot be amended with retrospective effect, the Attorney General said making submissions on a determination sought by President Maithripala Sirisena from the Supreme Court as regards the duration of the term of his presidency.The Supreme Court yesterday concluded arguments put forward in support and against the reference application forwarded by President Sirisena seeking an opinion whether it is constitutional for him to serve for a period of six years in the office of President and all parties in the application were directed to file their written submissions by today (12).Later on, the Supreme Courts determination over the reference application is to be communicated to the President before January 14.Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC yesterday informed the Supreme Court that people had exercised their sovereignty through the right of franchise to elect President Maithripala Sirisena to the office of President for a period of six years prior to the operation of 19th Amendment to the Constitution.He submitted that the incumbent President was elected by the people for the office to the term of 6 years. It is the sovereignty of the people who exercise their franchise to elect him as President. The power emanated from the franchise of the people. The commencement of his office should be considered from the date on which he is elected.He said it is the Constitutional structure where the incumbent President was elected. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution is operative after the incumbent President was elected for a term of 6 years by the people.He continued that therefore the issue is whether the Article 3 and 4 of the 19th Amendment made operative where the term of office has already commenced.Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appearing for an intervenient petitioner informed the Supreme Court that Presidents term should be confined to five years in accordance with the 19th Amendment to the constitution. The President in his website also insisted that he would like to limit his term of office. He agreed to have it for five years, Counsel stated.Seven intervenient petitioners filed their papers and made oral submissions regarding the Presidents reference.Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris, Manohara de Silva PC, Ali Sabry PC, Faiz Musthapha PC, Senior Counsel Kalyananda Thiraanagama, Senior Court Chrismal Warnasuriya appeared for the intervenient petitioners.The court said it will convey its decision to President Maithripala Sirisena.Meanwhile the Presidents Media Division, issuing a statement, said that two different views have been expressed in legal, civil and political circles about the duration of the term of Presidency after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.In order to dispel this confusion, the President has sought the opinion of the Supreme Court regarding the actual term of office.According to the powers vested on the President under the Constitution, the President has the right to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court, it said, adding, that the former Presidents who held office had also sought the opinion of the Supreme Court during their tenures.President invoked the Consultative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 129. (1) If at any time it appears to the President of the Republic that a question of law or fact has arisen or is likely to arise which is of such nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer that question to that Court for consideration and the Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, within the period specified in such reference or within such time as may be extended by the President, report to the President its opinion thereon.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/1799-attorney-general-says-president-s-term-covers-six-years", "title": "Attorney General says: President's term covers six years "},

Consumption is expected to stay strong, exports are anticipated to recover, and investment is on track to revive as a result of policy reforms and infrastructure upgrades it added.India is expected to pick up to 7.3 percent growth in FY 2018/19, which begins April 1, and to 7.5 percent in FY 2019/20, supported by strong private consumption and public spending on wage increases and infrastructure investments. Private investment is expected to revive as the private sector adjusts to the Goods and Services Tax and a global trade recovery lifts exports.Excluding India, growth in the region is projected to pick up to 5.8 percent in 2018 and to 5.9 percent the following year as domestic demand remains robust and exports recover. Pakistan is expected to accelerate to 5.8 percent in FY 2018/19, which begins July 1. Bangladesh will grow at 6.7 percent in FY 2018/19, benefitting from strong domestic demand and strengthened exports. Sri Lanka is forecast to accelerate to 5 percent in 2018, mainly reflecting strong private consumption and investment growth.RisksRisks to the outlook are mainly domestic. Setbacks to reform efforts in the corporate and financial sectors, disruptions due to natural disasters, and challenges that weaken domestic demand could subdue growth prospects. Increasing liabilities across the region could also derail fiscal consolidation efforts, with weaker debt sustainability dampening financial market confidence.Externally, an upswing in global financial volatility could slow growth. However, on the upside, stronger-than-expected global growth could result in faster growth than anticipated in the more open economies in the region.World Bank AssistanceThe World Bank approved $6.0 billion in lending to the region for 51 projects in fiscal 2017, including $2.2 billion in IBRD loans and $3.8 billion in IDA commitments, of which $0.9 billion came from the IDA Scale-Up Facility. The Bank also delivered 122 advisory services and analytical products, providing technical advice on such issues as competitiveness, energy sector reform, and fragility.

The support from the Government of Japan was inevitable to achieve this mile stone. While continuing the clearance operations in Mannar district, MAG is also looking forward to commence clearance activities in Mullaithivu District in partnership with the Government of Japan under this new project.Funding from the People of Japan will not only continue to save lives but also build futures by supporting livelihood development among some of the most mine-affected and poorest communities in the country.

The removal of these potentially lethal items have helped tens of thousands of people to resettle and rebuild their lives and livelihoods in Mannar District by providing safe land for agriculture, housing, schools and other community infrastructure.Early this year MAG successfully completed a systematic survey, which commenced in 2015, in six mine contaminated districts in Northern and Eastern provinces. The support from the Government of Japan was inevitable to achieve this mile stone. While continuing the clearance operations in Mannar district, MAG is also looking forward to commence clearance activities in Mullaithivu District in partnership with the Government of Japan under this new project.Funding from the People of Japan will not only continue to save lives but also build futures by supporting livelihood development among some of the most mine-affected and poorest communities in the country. With this continued Japanese support, MAG is looking forward to continuing clearance activities in support of the Government of Sri Lankas commitment to being mine impact free by 2020.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/1425-japan-to-extend-us-611-710-for-humanitarian-demining-in-northern-sri-lanka", "title": "Japan to Extend US$ 611,710 for Humanitarian Demining in Northern Sri Lanka"},

However, Colombo Harbor will continue to be used for development activities, while all workers will get their lost benefits, he said.It was in September 2014 when the agreement on the Hambantota Port was signed with the Chinese company, it was taken up for discussions and the cabinet approval was also received. It was during the period of former government. The clauses and conditions of that agreement were very critical. What the current government did was to amend those in a way which is better for the country. Those amendments included reduction of the land area to 50%, ensure its operation under the laws and regulations of the government of Sri Lanka and ensure not to let any country or any foreign company the ownership of even an inch of the land of Sri Lanka. The land will be given only on a lease, the President explained.No government had presented such an agreement to the Parliament before. Under my directive, that agreement was presented to the Parliament to ensure transparency.

No previous government had done such a thing. They also had planned to give 240 acres for Port City on free hold. We managed to change the Port City deal into a lease system but couldnt take any action against the deal with Shangri-la as they had already signed the relevant agreement, the President pointed out.Though whatever criticisms are done, I always emphasize that I will not hand over even an inch of Sri Lankan land to another country or any foreign company, he said.He emphasized that the government will create room for people to live in a prosperous country by winning over the economic challenges faced by the country.Though some people want to come to power very soon, there is no way to form a new government before an election to be held after 3 years from now, he stated.The President presented awards to the workers who completed 38 years of service at Sri Lanka Ports Authority.Sri Lanka Freedom Trade Union presented a souvenir to the President at this occasion.Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe, John Amaratunga, Filed Martial Sarath Fonseka, Gayantha Karunathilaka, State Minister A.

However, Colombo Harbor will continue to be used for development activities, while all workers will get their lost benefits, he said.It was in September 2014 when the agreement on the Hambantota Port was signed with the Chinese company, it was taken up for discussions and the cabinet approval was also received. It was during the period of former government. The clauses and conditions of that agreement were very critical. What the current government did was to amend those in a way which is better for the country. Those amendments included reduction of the land area to 50%, ensure its operation under the laws and regulations of the government of Sri Lanka and ensure not to let any country or any foreign company the ownership of even an inch of the land of Sri Lanka. The land will be given only on a lease, the President explained.No government had presented such an agreement to the Parliament before. Under my directive, that agreement was presented to the Parliament to ensure transparency. But the opposition did not use it as they had got the cabinet approvals for that agreement under many critical conditions when they were in power, he stated.He pointed out that the former government had sold out given six acres in front of the Galle Face Green to the Shangri-La Company.

President Putin, a known lover of antique weapons, graciously decided to part with one of his treasured antiques for the sake of friendship. It was a pleasant surprise for President Sirisena as the Russian leader gave this invaluable gift when he entered the Green Chimney Room in the Kremlin at the Red Square for bilateral talks with President Putin. The Russian leader said he was presenting this significant gift to President Sirisena symbolizing the close relationship between the two countries.When President Sirisena was admiring the shining weapon and its beautifully carved case which was studded with gems, Putin explained that it was an antique Kastane belonging to a Kandyan Nilame (Nobleman) and that it has a fascinating history.This sword had been brought to England in 1906 and later bought by Russia at the leading archeological artifact auction house, Sothebys in London. The Kastane (sword, hanger) was the major attribute of the noblemen of Sri Lanka. People who were not noble by origin were not eligible to bear or even keep a Kastane. Therefore, the purpose of such arm was to underline the stature of the bearer. According to Alex Freger (Tel Aviv), a high-profile Israeli expert on bladed weapons, the item subject to expertise descends from the Kandyan rulers (kings).Freger noted that the Kandy ruling class had always played an essential political and religious role in Sri Lanka. The temple which still keeps custody over the sacred Buddhist object  Tooth of Buddha  was located at the premises of the Royal Palace, and up to this day is the destination of pilgrims from all over the world.The Kastane was auctioned at the Sothebys Auction House on 19 December 2006 in the elite section of Property of a Princely Family and Other Aristocratic Estates.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/1466-president-gifts-the-gifted-kastane-to-national-museum", "title": "President gifts the gifted kastane to National Museum"},

The smooth sailing of this cabinet paper underlines the mutual understanding and trust between two pallbearers of the consensual government, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.After the two leaders met privately and sorted out issues, there was nothing for the cabinet members representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United National Party (UNP) to object to.As aptly described by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the Unity Government has reached the halfway point of its five-year term and the proposed NEC will help implement and speed up the economic activities already initiated by the Government. Political parties have their own philosophies, their own approaches, and it is necessary that we engage in discussions and arrive at a win-win situation, he said.NEC will be headed by the President, with the participation of the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Secretary to the President, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Secretaries to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs. The President will appoint a Secretary General to NEC and he/she will oversee functions and carry out decisions made by the Council.The fiscal and implementation aspects of economic policies will come under NEC. Generally, the Finance Ministry deals with the fiscal aspect, while the Planning Ministry oversees implementation.Hitherto, the economic policy decisions were formulated by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM), established on September 23, 2015 through a Cabinet decision.The CCEM is headed by the Prime Minister. After the establishment of NEC, the CCEM is expected to function under NEC and will be required to follow policy guidelines and other matters laid down by the superior body. Now, with the establishment of NEC, its Secretary-General is likely to represent NEC in the CCEM -if it continues to function- and in other relevant bodies, in respect of economic and financial matters.The CCEM has experienced retired officials who played in advisory capacities in the past. Their continued services through the CCEM would, no doubt, augment NEC.The setting up of NEC will solve issues raised by many SLFP Ministers and parliamentarians. Some of them complained that the CCEM has been functioning as a parallel cabinet and they, the SLFP Ministers could not get the CCEM to address their issues. Furthermore, NEC would provide the Unity Government headed by the President a healthy forum for constructive cooperation between the SLFP and UNP in formulating high level economic policies.There are sufficient experiences in the past on such cooperation among the partners in coalition governments. Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike cooperated with his cabinet colleagues in the 1956 government to usher in many economic reforms.His cabinet included ardent socialists such as, Philip Gunawardena and capitalists like Stanley Zoysa as well as conservatives like Wimala Wijewardene. But, the 56 government took may progressive steps like the enactment of the Paddy Lands Act, which benefited landless peasants, nationalizing privately owned bus services, establishment of Multi-Purpose Cooperatives, nationalization of the Harbour, establishment of the Ceylon Insurance Corporation, and The Peoples Bank, to develop the country in a systematic and wholesome manner.Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, too inducted socialist leaders to the Cabinet and adopted strong protectionist measures in a bid to strengthen the indigenous economy.Although Sirimavo Bandaranaike heavily depended on the advice of her late husbands capitalist nephew, Felix Dias Bandaranaike, her main economic program was fuelled by her Finance Minister Dr N.M Pereras Trotskyist line of thinking. Leader of the Communist Party, Peter Keuneman was also a member of the Cabinet and contributed to the left-leaning economic policy of Sirimavos government.While, President J.R Jayewardene introduced sweeping political and economic reforms under his leadership and initiated a major change in the politico-economic trajectory of the country, in 1977, his successor R Premadasa, sought to bring the regime closer to the masses through the Janasaviya program.The cabinet paper presented by President Sirisena stated, The NEC will be a professionally-managed, high-level, national advisory institution reporting directly to the President.Last week, the cabinet unanimously approved the setting up of a National Economic Council (NEC) after a brief discussion.

{"date": "July 12, 2017", "text": "The much awaited state visit to Bangladesh by President Maithripala Sirisena will take place this week at a time when the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), needs a solid push from these two founder-members for a speedy rejuvenation.Bangladesh-Sri Lanka friendship and cooperation does not need any reassurance as it is well established and growing from strength to strength. However, President Sirisena, realizing the paramount importance of close interaction with fellow leaders in the region, accepted the invitation extended by Premier Sheikh Hasina, two years ago. Earlier, the President was invited to be the chief guest at the Bangladesh National Day on March 26, but he could not undertake the journey as he had to return home from Moscow after a state visit to Russia on March 25, due to pressing issues in the country.Sri Lankas close political, social and religious ties go back to several centuries. The Theravada Buddhist community in Chittagong, has regarded Sri Lanka as a centre for Theravada Buddhist studies for centuries, while several leading Buddhist intellectuals in Bangladesh received their education in Pirivenas in this country. The highly respected Ven L Ariyawansho of Chittagong studied at the Molligoda Pirivena and became Chief Incumbent of the Mahabodhi Temple in New Delhi built by Indian philanthropist G K Birla, in the last century.When British rulers divided India and set up West Pakistan and East Pakistan (Bangladesh) in 1947, it was a foregone conclusion that the two Pakistans  divided by thousands of miles of Indian landmass  could not survive as a single nation. After the Awami League lead by charismatic leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, swept elections and became the largest single party in Pakistan, West Pakistan not only refused him Premiership, but imprisoned him and made Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, leader of the Peoples Party, the Prime Minister. It resulted in a long-drawn rebellion by Mukthi Bahini against Pakistani forces in East Pakistan. Although Sri Lanka allowed Pakistani Air Force to land in Colombo for refueling, since we maintained extremely cordial relations with South Asian countries including Pakistan, there was vast support for the Bangladeshi uprising, among the people in Sri Lanka.A high level independent intellectual team attended the international solidarity conference for Bangladesh held in New Delhi in 1970. Its leader, Sir Senarath (R S S) Gunawardane flayed the government decision to allow Pakistani planes to land in Colombo as political hypocrisy. However, when India and Pakistan declared war in December 1970, Sri Lanka stopped providing landing rights to Pakistani planes.Although in the Western Sector Pakistan could offer resistance, in the Eastern Sector (Bangladesh) Pakistani forces were easily defeated by the Indian forces with the support of the Mukthi Bahini rebels and 90,000 Pakistani forces had to surrender to save their lives. Pakistan released Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from Lahore prison in March 1971, and he flew first to New Delhi to attend a massive rally at the Ramleeela Grounds in Delhi together with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, before going to Dhaka to assume duties as first Prime Minister of the new nation, Bangladesh.Diplomatic relationsThe following year, Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations with Bangladesh and the relations between the two countries grew steadily. It was Bangladesh that proposed the setting up of the South Asian Regional Organization, and the first South Asian Summit that gave birth to SAARC was held in Dhaka in 1985. After 32 years, SAARC is faced with a crisis due to Indo-Pakistan issues. The Dhaka visit will be a good opportunity for a joint call by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Hasina for South Asian cooperation.Sri Lanka and Bangladesh established institutional frameworks to advance bilateral relations on the right track, holding consultations between the two foreign ministries. Subsequently, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have established a Joint Economic Commission (JEC). The presence of a sizable number of Sri Lankan expatriates and students in Bangladesh has built a bridge between the two countries. As President Sirisena told Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during their meeting on the sideline of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) in Jakarta recently, the two countries are cooperating and supporting each other at various regional and international organizations such as United Nations, Commonwealth, SAARC, BIMSTEC, Indian Ocean Rim Association and Asia Cooperation Dialogue.The volume of trade between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka increased to over USD 115 million in 2014-15 from USD 24 million ten years ago. The balance of trade is in favour of Sri Lanka; with an import to the tune of USD 92.81 million in 2015. Although the growth of bilateral trade in the last few years is significant, the volume of trade is not commensurate with its potentials. The two countries have been deliberating on the possibility of entering into a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) or a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with a view to enhancing bilateral trade. According to recent statistics, there are about 45 Lankan companies operating in Bangladesh with investment close to USD 300 m, mainly in the sectors of apparel, banking, paper, consumer goods, etc. The government of Bangladesh facilitates local and foreign investment through two main state agencies, namely, Board of Investment (BOI) and Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA).The two countries already have an Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation and Fiscal Evasion, and are currently negotiating a number of agreements that would facilitate trade and investment. Sri Lankas main imports from Bangladesh include, Pharmaceutical Products; Electrical Machinery & Equipment; Edible Vegetables & Roots; Apparel & Clothing Accessories; Iron & Steel; Textile Fibres; Chemicals; Sacks & Bags; Toilet & Facial Tissues; Cellular Phones and Bicycle Parts. Major exports to Bangladesh include, Textiles and Textile Articles; Enzymes; Chemicals; Minerals; Plastics; Rubber Products; Paper Products and Tea.The total bilateral trade between the two countries has grown more than twofold from US$ 48 million in 2010 to US$ 131 million in 2015. Sri Lankas exports to Bangladesh too saw a steady increase in the past five years. In 2013 it recorded the highest increase of 45% (compared to 2012). Lankan exports are mainly, cotton (26.1%) followed by man-made staple fibers (13.1%), plastic articles (12.1%) and knitted/crocheted fabrics (10.9%). Among Sri Lankas imports from Bangladesh are Pharmaceuticals (31%) followed by Rice (29.3%), Electric accumulators (6.3%) and apparel and garments (6%). In 2015, import of Pharmaceuticals have surged by 61% over 2014. While discussing the forthcoming visit with Bangladesh High Commissioner, Riaz Hamidullah, President Maithripala Sirisena expressed the view that Sri Lanka would like to learn from Bangladesh about its disaster management preparedness programs. As a country facing periodic natural calamities, Bangladesh has established a sound rapid preparedness program for disaster management.The President expressed interest in the new agricultural seeds with drought resistance qualities developed by Bangladesh. President Sirisena told the Ambassador that the historical bond of friendship has become stronger through deepening engagements at bilateral, regional and international levels.

In order to respond to increasing demand, augmentation of Kalu Ganga Water Supply System and Non revenue Water reduction is imperative.Accordingly, the Government of Japan has agreed to provide a concessional loan of Japanese Yen 31,810 million (Approximately Rs. 42,976 million) to implement Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project (I) to provide safe water and increase water supply efficiency in the southern area of the Western Province by expanding Kalu Ganage water supply facilities and restructuring water distribution networks, thereby contributing to the improvement of the living conditions of the people. Accordingly, it is expected to expand Kalu Ganga Water Supply System and to reduce Non Revenue Water by restructuring water distribution networks in Dehiwala and Moratuwa areas.The Exchange of Notes of the above projects were signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of Japan during the Hon. Prime Ministers visit to Japan in April 2017. The signing of Loan Agreements pertaining to the above loans took place today, at the Ministry of Finance & Mass Media. Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga, Secretary, Ministry of Finance & Mass Media on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and Mr. Fusato Tanaka, Chief Representative of JICA Sri Lanka Office on behalf of JICA signed the above Loan Agreements.Ministry of Finance & Mass Media", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/1375-rs-60-billion-from-japan-for-infra-structure-development-projects-under-47th-yen-loan-package", "title": "Rs. 60 billion from Japan for infra structure development projects under 47th Yen Loan Package"},

The race takes riders from hot and humid jungles, through mountain hugging tea plantations and across the islands highest plateau.Rumble in the Jungle not only succeeds in showcasing the vivid landscape of Sri Lanka but also promotes a carbon neutral sport to further cement the airlines commitment to become a carbon neutral airline in time to come. This years race attracted over 35 riders from 15 different countries. It has become one of the most highly regarded races amongst the international mountain biking community.Rumble in the Jungle is an annual cycling event that stretches out over 4 days. This race is not only competitive, but also offers a thrilling experience to international riders as they get an authentic local experience riding through the country. Along the race, riders need to wade across rivers, ride through dense jungle, which is home to wild elephants, leopards and snakes, tackle 1000+m climbs and negotiate bone clattering rocky descents. Intense humidity, leeches, baking sun, torrential rain, mud, sand, rock and over 7000m of ascent combine to make this race the adventure of a lifetime, on one of the worlds most idyllic islands.The first phase of race was from scenic Kuda Oya to Haputale, starting on the flat southern plains of the island, just 100m above sea level, entering virgin jungle where riders battled prickly and dense vegetation and tackled numerous river crossings. Upon leaving the jungle, the route climbed rapidly for close to 30km before reaching the highest point of the day at 1650m, finally descending through working tea plantations to Haputale.The next stage was centred around Haputale and Lipton's Loop and was characterized by a 1200m descent over 16 km, mostly over super rough terrain; at the bottom of which was a verdant jungle. A brutal 700m climb, followed later by another 500m climb took riders back up to 1850m above sea level for a final descent back into Haputale through working tea plantations.The next stage stretched from Kalupahana to Nuwara Eliya, taking in Sri Lanka's highest waterfall, Bambarakanda; crossing the highest plateau, Horton Plains; and finishing in the highest town, Nuwara Eliya. This stage started with a 17km, 1300m climb, the majority of which is on rocky trail. At 2100m, once on the plateau, the temperature dropped dramatically and the area was shrouded in mist. The plains are host to a large Sambar deer population and home to one of the world's most endangered primates, the Slender Loris. A scintillating descent down from the plateau and another 17km ascent through the New Zealand farm brought riders into Nuwara Eliya.The final leg of the race, the Ramdoda to Kandy stretch was Down Time, with over 2600m of descent. After a 20km, 900m descent group ride on the main road out of Nuwara Eliya, the race commenced from the Bluefield Tea plantation with a tough 8km, 500m ascent. After this it was practically all downhill for the next 48km, dropping 1100m through remote villages back into the lowlands. The race finished in Kandy.At the end of the race in Kandy, the riders took the train to Colombo, where they gathered at the Galadari Hotel for the closing ceremony, during which the winners were announced by SriLankan Airlines.In order to deepen the impact of the sport, SriLankan Airlines flew down famed cyclist Cory Wallace for the event, the 24-hour Solo World Championship title winner, which served to enhance great interest in the race this year. The champion cyclist shared his knowledge at an event organized by SriLankan Airlines, called Ride with a Pro, which witnessed the coming together of clubs such as Vroom, Pedal Pushers, Boralu Boyz and the Air Force to not only learn from the best but to ride alongside a world champion. Ride with a Pro was held at Spinners in Thalawathugoda.Cory Wallace is a renown cycling champion. Hailing from Canada, Cory is a pro mountain biker with quite a number of titles under his belt. Among his most recent, is winning the World Solo 24 Hour Mountain Bike Championships. Cory grabbed the championship convincingly beating the 7 time champion Jason English by 1 lap.The airline has implemented many sustainable environmental programmes under its planet friendly SriLankan initiative, with this mountain biking event being one such.
