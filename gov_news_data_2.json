By 2030, Asia will surpass North America and Europe on gross domestic product and investment in technology. Consumer markets are emerging across Asia as the Asian middle class rises sharply, said Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.He made these comments addressing the 2nd Session of the Leaders Roundtable of the One Belt-One Road Forum for International Co-operation, 15th May in Beijing, China.The Indian Ocean Rim association with its sustained growth and an expanding population will become the fastest growing region. The high rate of growth in South Asia is one of the main drivers of this growth. The One Belt and One Road Initiative will further accelerate this process. Sri Lanka plans to use its strategic location and leverage on our connectivity to become the Hub of the Indian Ocean. The National Unity Government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena brings together the two main political parties in the country, giving us the opportunity to bring about this strategic repositioning, said the Prime Minister.The Government has already commenced the development of the three major ports - Colombo, Hambantota and Trincomalee, and the two international airports - Colombo and Mattala, which are all connected by road and rail to the proposed special Economic Zones. These initiatives will transform Sri Lanka into a shipping, aviation, and a logistics hub. Sri Lanka is also focusing on building the hard infrastructure such as the roads, water supply and power supply. The One Belt and One Road Initiative complements Sri Lankas own initiative as they share the same synergies. Several of these advanced infrastructure projects, including the Hambantota Port, the Mattala airport and the Southern expressway have been carried out with finances from Chinese institutions such as the Exim Bank.Furthermore, Sri Lanka is strengthening financial connectivity by establishing an offshore financial centre in the Port City, which is a Real Estate Development project commenced under the One Belt and One Road Initiative.Sri Lanka is also expanding trade connectivity. Today the EU Journal will grant us the GSP+ Tariff Concessions. The FTA with India is being deepened. We are also negotiating FTAs with China and Singapore, said the Prime Minister. We have undertaken the restructuring of our economy including financial stabilization, reviewing administrative regulations to cut red tape, lowering tariffs and introducing a simpler tax system.These measures will fully integrate us with the Global Value Chain thereby obtaining the maximum benefits of the 4th Industrial Revolution.Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that the One Belt and One Road Initiative will provide the much needed hard and soft connectivity in the Indian Ocean required for rapid economic and social development. History has shown that peace and Freedom of Navigation in the Indian Ocean always resulted in economic growth and prosperity. Similarly, the success of this Initiative and the Hub will also depend on the maintenance of long-term stability in the Indian Ocean by (i) promoting peaceful and non-military cooperation - the 5 principles of Peaceful Co-existence and (ii) ensuring unimpeded commerce based on the multilateral trading system.The One Belt and One Road Initiative is the first economic cooperation arrangement connecting the Eurasian continents. Combining the high-income economies with the fast growing economies will create new opportunities for the growth of global trade.This initiative is proposed by President Xi Jinping; China is providing the initial funding. But we cannot pass all responsibility to China. I commend the Bretton Woods Institution for coming forward to assist. All of us must take ownership, he said.

The preliminary rounds of the tea competition were held in Sri Lanka and 98 samples of the best teas under the seven main agro-climatic regions as well as Ceylon Green Teas, CTC Teas and Innovative Teas/Hand Made Teas were taken to china for the final. The grand finale was concluded at the National Agriculture Exhibition Centre in Beijing amid the 9th International Chinese Tea Exhibition. The First Charity Tea Auction took place at the Event Hall of the exhibition location during the following day. An amount of RMB 104,300 was raised at the first ever tea auction Sri Lanka organized for Ceylon Tea in China.The second charity tea auction was held during the subsequent day at the Beijing Exhibition Center (Russian Centre). While all the gold winners were auctioned, only a few selected Silver and Bronze winners were identified for sale. An amount of RMB, 41,600 was realized through the second auction.The total sum realized from both auctions amounted to RMB 145,900 which is approximately SL Rs. 3.2 Million.Shenzhen Shenbao a major buyer of Ceylon Teas who continue to patronize the importation of teas from Sri Lanka turned-out to be the highest bidder at the First Charity Tea Auction by securing the Nuwara Eliya Region Gold Award, Lovers Leap Garden Mark FBOP, at a price of RMB 10,000 for the 05 kilos package (approx. SL Rs. 44,000/kilo). The Pedro Estate under Kelani Valley Plantations own this garden marks. Fuzhou Bailitong was identified as a buyer of the largest number of winning tea lines at the Charity Auction. The Chinese importer was an active participant at the 1st ever Ceylon Tea Auction in China and strongly patronized some of the best teas from Sri Lanka while out bidding others to secure the lots.The other largest Chinese Tea buyer was recognized at Baijing Chayuan Co. They also injected strong impetus to the Auction by purchasing four of the best lots.China is the worlds largest producer and consumer of tea and also the second biggest exporter of tea after Kenya. The nation has been also identified as the country with the fastest growth for Ready to Drink (RTD)Teas although USA and Japan are considered as the two largest global customers in this category. From a traditional green tea consuming society for centuries, the elite, the new burgeoning middle class and the younger generation is moving gradually but steadily towards product innovations and novel differentiations even in the tea beverage. Thus, imported black tea has been caught in this current. Sri Lanka is ideally placed to take the advantage of this new trend as the globally reputed supplier of quality orthodox black tea. Since 2010 to 2016 period, the growth of Chinese tea exports to the world has been calculated at an annual 1.4%. In direct contrast, the annual increase of foreign tea imports to China during the same period has been registered at 14.3%. This implies that, China is bound to import a larger volume of black tea during the years to come. Sri Lanka who exported only just over one million kilos to China in 2010, has supplied 8 million kilos of Ceylon Tea in 2016. Further, Sri Lanka is the leader in the Chinese tea market in respect of the imported tea segment effectively relegating Vietnam and India to the second and third positions. Today, the Sri Lankas share in the Chinese tea imports has grown to 38% by end of 2016 and optimism are high for a rapid rise.Embassy of Sri Lanka in Beijing25th May 2017The cradle of tea civilization is China and nobody in the global tea fraternity dispute this fact. However, what happened few days ago in Beijing, the ancient Forbidden City was truly remarkable.The Sri Lanka tea industry which celebrates 150 years anniversary in 2017 from a small beginning in 1867 through a 19 acres for tea plantations in Loolcondera Estate utilizing the plants (tea cultivar) brought originally from China, presented it to their ancestors.

{"date": "June 14, 2017", "text": "Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his advisors, instead of working to take our country to the heights that our country could have achieved soon after the conclusion of the conflict in 2009, chose to run our country to the ground. He made our country heavily indebted on the one hand, having borrowed at exorbitantly high, commercial rates; while taking decisions that made Sri Lanka withdraw from the international stage, on the other, thus making our country and our people isolated and shunned by the world. He hides the fact that time after time, major donor countries voted against Sri Lanka at the time, in international financial institutions.Having eventually lost an election which he himself called for, ahead of time, he appears to still not be able to come to terms with that loss. His hunger for power makes him and his advisors continue to indulge in the lies, tricks and games that were so much a part of his regime and so much a part of his personality. Just recently we saw how he lied to the people about his travel to Japan. He said that he was travelling to Japan at the invitation of the Emperor of Japan! The Embassy of Japan responded to a question from a journalist denying this. Why resort to this kind of lying to hoodwink the people, Mr. Rajapaksa? If you are in fact a follower of the teachings of Gautama Buddha as you try to show the people, isnt it about time, at least at this stage of your life, to try to abide by even one of the five precepts, and refrain from indulging in lies.Mr. Rajapaksa, in a statement titled Government should not create unrealistic expectations about GSP Plus says that obtaining the GSP Plus facility is trivial, since Sri Lanka is very close to passing the threshold of an upper middle income country.He conveniently hides a fundamental issue. A country has to be classified as \"upper middle income\" by the World Bank for three consecutive years in order to be no longer eligible for the GSP Plus. Even if Sri Lanka were to reach that threshold tomorrow, we would still have access to the advantages of GSP Plus for three years, and for one additional year after the decision is taken to withdraw the benefit. This shows that Mr. Rajapaksa is clearly trying to distort facts because he cant acknowledge the fact that the National Unity Government has in fact managed to obtain a formidable boost to Sri Lankas economy, in application of Article 4(1) of the GSP Regulation of 2012, for at least four years.This period of, at the very least four years, comes just when the European economy starts to show signals of growth recovery. With less unemployment and more consumer demand, this is the moment to join in enhanced partnershipwith the European Union!But let me add a point. Mr. Rajapaksas reasoning that we shouldn't aspire to a better deal, because some time in the future the economy will grow is callous and insensitive to the workers of our country and their families. It reflects a complete lack of concern for our workers who expect progress in the immediate present, and they deserve progress in the immediate present. So what if Sri Lanka, thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of its entrepreneurs and workers looks poised to cross a certain threshold of average income? Does it mean that we, as a government, should sit on our hands without giving them the opportunity for a better deal that they deserve now in the present? Shouldn't we help them to reach our national goals sooner rather than later?The idea that GSP Plus puts Sri Lanka \"under the supervision\" of the EU is simply absurd. By committing to a number of universal human rights principles, we do nothing that was not already recommended by Sri Lankan people who came before the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to give their input and views. Protecting every citizen from torture is not an alien imposition. It is a sovereign decision from a humanistic nation, towards its own citizens, inspired by the most sacred human values and principles. How ironic that Mr. Rajapaksa who claims to be not just a follower but a guardian of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not advocate granting the very basic human rights principles and rights and freedoms to the citizens of this country! Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of protection? Dont our citizens deserve the highest standards of human rights and freedoms?It was incompetence and arrogance of Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors, and their determination to deny the people of this country their rightsthat resulted in Mr. Rajapaksa failing to retain the GSP Plus facility. It was ill-advised to not implement the 2011 recommendations of the LLRC, a Commission which he himself appointed, to protect citizens from torture, criminalize disappearances, and fully investigate cases of human rights violations. In fact it was an injustice caused to the law abiding soldiers of this country as well. Having failed himself, and the people of our country, now in 2017, it is simply invidious to criticize a successful measure that the Government seeks to implement for the benefit of the people of our country.We know very well how Mr. Rajapaksa and his advisors tried until the last minute to retain the GSP Plus facility in 2010, and lost. Licking their wounds, they then sought to lie to the people by saying that he decided to not pursue the facility, to avoid damage to the countrys political, legal and institutional framework. He probably still cant get over those lies. So he keeps repeating them in different formulations and words even seven years later in 2017.For this government, the GSP Plus system is a partnership that helps our nation and our people regain their due place once again on the international stage as a respected nation and a respected people standing shoulder to shoulder with the international community, shedding the pariah tatters that the former government chose to put on our nation and our people. Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people deserve the best in the world. Sri Lanka is a proud nation and the Sri Lankan people are a proud people with the self-confidence to speak and act as equals with every country or group of countries in the world. We don't need to hide from global dialogue in order to feel better. On the contrary, we feel stronger when our laws reflect the best of global humanism, when our citizens benefit from the best law enforcement, when our workers and entrepreneurs see the ports of the world open to the fruit of their efforts.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/1267-minister-mangala-samaraweera-responds-to-mr-s-statement-on-gsp-concession", "title": "Minister Mangala Samaraweera responds to MRs statement on GSP+ concession"},

We denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities in our country.We are deeply saddened by the destruction of property and loss of livelihoods as a result of recent incidents, and the pain of mind and fear caused to individuals.We affirm that hate filled expressions and actions by individuals and groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic, religious backgrounds has no place in Sri Lankan society.While reaffirming the Governments commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence, and the rule of law, we direct the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country.

Communal, ethnic and religious hatred and violence, and impunity have no place in the society that we strive to build.In this context, we are deeply concerned by the recent incidents of violence targeting places of religious worship, shops and business enterprises, and houses. We denounce in the strongest terms, these acts of violence and hatred, including incidents of hate speech by certain individuals and groups aimed at inciting violence against the different ethnic and religious communities in our country.We are deeply saddened by the destruction of property and loss of livelihoods as a result of recent incidents, and the pain of mind and fear caused to individuals.We affirm that hate filled expressions and actions by individuals and groups with vested interests, resulting in demeaning, denigrating and inciting violence against fellow citizens of various ethnic, religious backgrounds has no place in Sri Lankan society.While reaffirming the Governments commitment to reconciliation, peace building, peaceful co-existence, and the rule of law, we direct the law enforcement authorities to immediately take all necessary steps in accordance with the law of the land, against instigators and perpetrators of violence and hate speech targeting any religious and ethnic groups in the country. The strictest action must be taken without delay, in accordance with the law, against all persons or groups who act to incite violence, and engage in acts of violence. The law must be applied to all regardless of social status, ethnic or religious background or political affiliations of perpetrators of such acts. We also direct the law enforcement authorities and the Hon. Attorney General to expedite action against those responsible for all atrocities committed, as impunity holds the dangerous possibility of our country receding into conflict. We express our deep appreciation to civil society and religious leaders who have stepped up to counter the attempts of a few to spread hate in our country, and who have called for calm and peaceful co-existence at this time.We take this opportunity to urge the active participation and leadership of all Sri Lankans in efforts aimed at reconciliation and fostering peaceful co-existence in our country, without which, the stability and economic growth and progress that our nation so richly deserves will continue to elude us.Gautama Buddhas Teachings emphasize the importance of co-existence, tolerance, respect and compassion. This nation is blessed by the teachings of the four great religious traditions in the world  Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam  which provide us the guidance required for peaceful co-existence, upholding human values, and honest and hard work required to rebuild our nation as one of the most progressive in the region.We urge all the citizens of this nation, young and old, to contribute their best to our country as patriotic citizens to build a nation that is stable, peaceful, and progressive; a society where the dignity of each individual is upheld; where diversity is respected; and where every individual has the opportunity to enjoy the freedoms that are the rights of equal citizenship.We must all stand united to strive to eliminate this dangerous affliction of hatred towards each other, and resolve that we will never allow ourselves in the present or in the future, to once again be dragged into conflict as in the past.

{"date": "June 08, 2017", "text": "Madame President - Mr. Secretary GeneralAllow me to express my appreciation to those who have been responsible for organizing this conference  notably Mr. Peter Thomson - President of the General Assembly, the Governments of Fiji and Sweden - co-hosts of the Conference, the Permanent Representatives of Portugal and Singapore - facilitators of preparatory meetings and to the Secretary General of the Conference.This assembly is part of a historic process  The collective international efforts to define and correct the depredations of humankind on the Planet Earth. It is a relatively recent effort, beginning with the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm and the Stockholm Declaration in 1972. Since then we have made much progress in recognizing the environment and its protection as the responsibility of all nations. We have largely accepted the connection between ecological management and the human condition. We have had many conferences, created many institutions. Public awareness and concern about the environment is wider than at any time in history. Yet with all these developments, we have still a long way to go to reach the optimum level of global environmental sustainability.This is why the work and outcome of this conference is so important. The oceans constitute about 70 percent of the earths surface and contain 97 percent of the earths water. If we do not make more progress on the oceans, the seas and maritime resources, all our other environment efforts will be difficult, if not impossible to achieve. In many ways then, this has vital significance for the future of humankind. The condition of the oceans, so well described in the concept papers and the discussions of delegates, enhance the urgency of our task.As we proceed with our deliberations, there is an area which my government believes needs more attention. This is the organization of funding sources. For commitments to become reality requires not only sustainable programmes but also sustainable financing. Alongside corrective measures and technical developments, we need to create a sustainable ocean economy, new blue -industries including off-shore renewables, marine technologies, aqua cultures, clean-up and transition activities. Government financing and philanthropic support will probably be insufficient and we will have to encourage creative private public partnerships and other means to unlock commercial capital. These are ways in which we can mobilize new stakeholders and collaborators whose support will help ensure broader constituency for our endeavors.The outcome of this conference and several like gatherings scheduled in the near future also must link to parallel concerns  notably the institutional legal framework contained in UNCLOS and its implementing agreements and institutions. My government and I personally have urged the adoption of measures related to the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. We strongly believe that such measures will help to initiate a stable zone of economic progress that can eventually embrace larger ocean areas and will provide the stability that accelerates rapid environment improvement.Environmental interconnectivity can provide an opportunity for peacekeeping, peacemaking and development that will bring multiple benefits to several regions in and around South and Southeast Asia and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.Madame President,Island nations like my own, are particularly vulnerable to the impact of ocean environments and climate change. In the past decade or so, Sri Lanka has been devastated by nature driven tragedies. Floods and landslides of 2003, the massive Tsunami of 2004 and other disasters have wrecked my country. Right now, as I speak, we are inundated with savage floods causing hundreds of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Human misery is unbelievable. We are grateful to the international community, the United Nations and its agencies and the Secretary General, and so many generous contributions of assistance. But, all this underlines how helpless we are in the face of environmentally sourced disasters.For nations like my own, the oceans are life and death. The Indian Ocean, in which we are located, provides employment, food, avenues of trade and commerce. Our large coastal communities survive at ocean level. For us, rise of the seas, pollution of the oceans, depletion of fish, good coastal eco systems are not abstractions  they are the core of our existence. Parenthetically, I might mention that the Indian Ocean around us now has the second largest accumulation of floating plastic waste in the world. Cleansing the oceans, assuring maritime sustainability is our future  and we increasingly ask: What is our future unless this is done?We are deeply conscious that our fate is not in our hands alone. This is especially why we are so supportive of international environment actions. We strongly endorse the Paris Climate Agreement which was ratified on our behalf by Sri Lankas President His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena. We affirm our commitment to the FAO International Plan of Action and are implementing the Sri Lanka National Plan of Action on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. We consistently stand behind every significant international environmental agreement, especially the Sustainable Development goals and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It is our hope that the collective interest embodied in these instruments will be the basis for a new consensus.Madame PresidentI come from a culture, a country where our philosophic heritage cherished the sanctity of the environment. The Lord Buddha, widely venerated in our part of the world, enjoined people to preserve it for prosperity. The passage of time, the exigencies of modernization and the separation of individuals from their natural habitat have undercut that message. But the wisdom of such sage advice, which nurtured our ancestors, is now starkly evident. And conferences such as this, remind us that we must reclaim our heritage or perish.Madame President,For 72 years, the United Nations has worked, with varying degrees of success, on the global agenda as it has evolved. The here and now, the immediacies of the world, largely engage the attention of the UN. Although it tries, there is understandably not much space available to focus on the future. But surely, part of our task is also to shape Planet Earth so that we will leave a heritage that generations to come will welcome.Our efforts in the environmental area fulfill that obligation. That is why I strongly endorse the objectives of this Conference and hope that your deliberations will create practical, prompt and inclusive results. Todays urgencies and our legacy for the future demand no less.Thank YouAddress by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the UN Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for Sustainable Development, United Nations, New York, 5th June 2017.

The Minister points out such changes in the local economy have been recognized internationally although it is not palatable to certain extremist politicians.Minister Karunanayake stated these views during a ceremony held at the Finance Ministry yesterday (27th March) to mark the conferment of the award for the Best Finance Minister of Asia Pacific Region on him by an internationally recognized London based Financial Magazine The Banker.Speaking further, Minister Ravi Karunanayake expressed the following views as well:We wouldnt have been able to achieve this victory without the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. I made a request soon after I assumed duty on January 10, 2015. That is to work together like one family and take the ministry activities forward. My request was honored. Certain groups in Sri Lanka looked at our work with a crooked eye but our work has been assessed and appreciated internationally. This award is clear evidence to our good work and our journey forward. We should use this international recognition in building up our country.A country cannot run on loans. Loans should be turned into investment. When independence was declared for our country in 1948, Japan remained equal to Sri Lanka. However, per capita income in Japan is currently USD 55,000 while ours is USD 4000. What is the barrier standing before us? It is the way of our thinking, our work and the way of how we negotiate with the rest of the world. Therefore, we have a good opportunity to think anew.When we assumed office, the countrys revenue was not sufficient to repay loan installments. But unity and the commitment by the people helped us to make achievements. We are now earning more than that of the recurrent expenditure. Therefore we do not need to obtain loans to repay already taken loans. The difficulties faced by the people today are a commitment that made to ensure a better tomorrow. The existing taxes will be reduced within a short time and benefits will be passed on to the people soon, the minister said.Parliamentarians Nalin Bandara, Hector Appuhamy and Acting Secretary of the Finance Ministry Chandra Ekanayake, Deputy Secretaries S.R. Atygalle and A.R. Deshapriya and several ministry officials participated in this event.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/916-emerging-international-image-on-sri-lanka-would-bring-benefits-to-people-finance-minister-2", "title": "Emerging international image on Sri Lanka would bring benefits to people - Finance Minister"},

Accordingly, the National Loan Protection Scheme initiated for the purpose, on behalf of the farmers will pay their banks loan outstanding after having assessed the crop damages.The government has estimated that some of Rs 500 Million will have to be paid to banks in lieu of the loan obtained by the farmers during 2016/2017 maha season.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was elected as the chairman of the conference. It is significant that the member nations of the region recognized Sri Lanka for her polices on financial disciplines and transparency.Delivering the Keynote address, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that Sri Lanka has embarked on a new journey towards sustainable development thereby intending to pass on the benefits equally to every citizen in the country.Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in his speech that the population in the region is ageing faster than its growth of development therefore necessary infrastructure should be put in place to meet the demand by ageing population in the future.Addressing the conference, the Finance Minister further said:Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world. Between 1970 and 2014, the region has been affected by more than 5,223 natural disasters according to ESCAP Statistics, and that was 43% of the globally reported disasters. Further, more than 6 billion people in the region were affected by natural disasters accounting for 89% of the global total.Natural disasters cause loss of lives as well as massive financial losses. Asia and the Pacific alone reported economic losses amounting to almost US dollars 1.22 trillion for this, or 44% of the global total. During the past 10 years alone, climate related disasters in Asia and the Pacific caused damages of US Dollars 367 billion, resulted in the death of nearly 300,000 people, and a total of 1.37 billion people were affected.Sri Lanka is going through a remarkable transition today powered by a well-crafted medium-term macroeconomic policy framework. Sri Lanka now has a peaceful environment to do business after ending three-decade long separatist movement. But as the new government took office in January 2015 we had to tackle an array of challenges from many fronts.Our policy is focused towards developing the country containing broad policies of national importance that will assist the achievement of the far reaching reforms. For instance, my theme for the National Budget 2017 was Accelerated growth with social inclusion, which placed great emphasis on the alleviation of poverty in all manifestations beginning 2017. Social inclusion is a matter of prime concern and the participation of the entire population in the journey for development is a noble objective being 'a society for all'. Such efforts will lay tremendous emphasis on social inclusion and sustainability in economic development, a commitment to achieve the United Nations proclaimed UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 ensuring shelter, safe drinking water and improved living standards for all.I wish to note that while the government is strongly committed to ensuring growth with social inclusion, the fiscal space remains constrained with historically low revenues of around 10-12% of GDP. Thus in the last two years in particular, significant emphasis has been placed on increasing revenue to augment the revenue to GDP ratio to at least 15-17% in the medium term. As such, measures have been taken to broaden the tax base through elimination of exemptions. We will also be introducing a new Inland Revenue Act, which has a simplified tax code and it is expected to facilitate better administration and compliance. At the same time, the introduction of Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) which connects the three revenue institutions with 27 other entities is also expected to generate better efficiencies in revenue collection. The Department of Customs and Excise also has seen structural improvements been introduced.Our government is working towards encouraging more private sector participation in the equity markets through major reforms which are centered on the introduction of a new Securities and Exchange Act and the Demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) which is still a member-owned entity. This is expected to create better accountability and confidence amongst the investor community.It is now abundantly clear that options for financing infrastructure may greatly depend on the medium-term economic outlook and potential headwinds that we may encounter in the global economic environment. In this backdrop, debt-fueled infrastructure development and economic growth may not be a viable option. Hence, the question we all would have to engage in is how governments could unlock any fiscal space for infrastructure spending and other funding requirement for development.I believe that one of the fundamental challenges for the Asia-Pacific economies, in the medium-term, will be to increase revenue generation. Advanced economies in particular have a long history of using taxes and government spending to smoothen business cycles. If not properly designed and implemented, taxes can harm growth because they distort economic incentives and behavior.It is noteworthy to consider that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for nearly 40 per cent of global illicit financial outflows including tax evasion which was the largest share on a regional basis. The efforts have been initiated since 1970 to implement regional cooperative frameworks for tax administration in Asia Pacific with the establishment of the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR).We are seeing an increase in the private participation in infrastructure development, attracted by rising demand for quality infrastructure and expectations of high returns. This has been made possible through different variations of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the region. So, PPPs have emerged as a viable procurement method for infrastructure development in the region. We ought to implement PPP related reforms such as enacting PPP laws, streamlining PPP procurement and bidding processes, introducing dispute resolution mechanisms, and establishing independent PPP government units.General Secretary to UN ESCAP Mrs. Shamshad Akthar, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Thailand Kshenuka Senevirathna, Deputy Treasury Secretaries S.R.

Hence, the question we all would have to engage in is how governments could unlock any fiscal space for infrastructure spending and other funding requirement for development.I believe that one of the fundamental challenges for the Asia-Pacific economies, in the medium-term, will be to increase revenue generation. Advanced economies in particular have a long history of using taxes and government spending to smoothen business cycles. If not properly designed and implemented, taxes can harm growth because they distort economic incentives and behavior.It is noteworthy to consider that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for nearly 40 per cent of global illicit financial outflows including tax evasion which was the largest share on a regional basis. The efforts have been initiated since 1970 to implement regional cooperative frameworks for tax administration in Asia Pacific with the establishment of the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR).We are seeing an increase in the private participation in infrastructure development, attracted by rising demand for quality infrastructure and expectations of high returns. This has been made possible through different variations of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the region. So, PPPs have emerged as a viable procurement method for infrastructure development in the region. We ought to implement PPP related reforms such as enacting PPP laws, streamlining PPP procurement and bidding processes, introducing dispute resolution mechanisms, and establishing independent PPP government units.General Secretary to UN ESCAP Mrs. Shamshad Akthar, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Thailand Kshenuka Senevirathna, Deputy Treasury Secretaries S.R.

We should take forward this country towards development and prosperity living in peace and coexistence. This can be achieved only by defeating racism and establishing unity among the communities.Our prayers and expectations are that all Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and Christians in this multi-ethnic society should strive to achieve to prosperity, development and progress by following the religious advice and developing the ethic of respecting other religious.The All Ceylon JamiyyathulUlama therefore, supplicates to God, the Almighty, to shower His blessings on every Sri Lankan citizen who shall make effort to bring unity, peace, coexistence and reconciliation through which build a prosperous Nation.Message from the Mahanayaka Thero of Sri Lanka Ramagna Maha Nikaya  Independence Day is the day that is important to all Sri Lankan citizens. Sri Lanka became an independent nation on 4th February 1948 after being ruled by Europeans for over four hundred years. It reminds the struggles launched by all Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim leaders with unity. As the unity among ethnic groups has decayed after the independence, all Sinhala, Tami, and Muslim communities had to experience massive disasters within the past decades. That separation is the main cause that obstructed the economic prosperity of our country. The separation was done by politicians who misled the public to gain their political power. Some who did not realise this truth are doing the same mistake again. I kindly request all citizens to work together by promoting the national reconciliation to overcome the present economic crisis in the country in a moment that the country is being healing after the end of a 30 year cruel war. Religious and political leaders should lead this way. Many of our problems will be automatically solved when the country becomes an economically developed country.Most Ven. Napana Pemasiri TheroMessage from the Mahanayaka Thero of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha NikayaSri Lanka which is our country has a written history of about a period of 2358 years which was ruled by one hundred and eighty two (182) kings. There were invasions in those days too but they could be defeated with the assistance of religious leadership. It is evident in Sri Lankan history that Sri Lanka could be completely defeated in 02 March 1815 due to the separations of Sinhalese leaders caused by revenge, and lust to power, wealth and positions. The country was self-sufficient and it is said that about hundred thousand paddy fields (Wellassa) were in just the Monaragala District and about 35000 reservoirs were made to protect rainwater. It is said that giants were in the country and before 69 years the independence was gained by citizens who are not physical giants but giants with their patriotism. As the country was surrendered by English in 1815 Sinhalese were brave to perform a riot again in 1818. We have such a history.This is the 69th independence celebration. In retrospect it is clear that we are far behind the other Asian countries who received independence after our country no matter who ruled the country within this period. Hence, I kindly bless on behalf of all the monks that this celebration will open the way to build a united and developed country with a broad dialogue between the rulers and public.Bless everyone for the wellbeing of all beings with the power of the triple gem!!!Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara TheroMessage from the Mahanayaka Thero of Malwathu Chapter of the Syamopali Maha Nikaya of the Mahavihara AncestryIt is a pleasure that the government has taken steps to hold a colourful Independence Day celebration as usual. The first threat of invasions affected the Sri Lankan sovereignty and independence was from Chola Empire. Subsequently, Portuguese, Dutch and English invasions have severely affected our independence as well as national, religious, social, academic and cultural aspects. This caused a decline in spiritual aspects and lifestyle of people.Although 69 years have been spend after the independence, bad consequences of caused in the colonial age have not been completely overcome. The time has come to consider this matter deeply by the leaders as well as public of the country and it should be understood as their foremost task and responsibility. Everyone should commit to gain economic development and prosperity in the country keeping unity and development of the country in foremost place and protecting one's religious beliefs and cultural identities and through improving coexistence and humanitarian morals. All Sri Lankans are hereby blessed with the blessings of the triple gem and tooth relic to enjoy the true meaning of independence.Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala TheroMessage from the Mahanayake thero of Asgiri Chapter of the Syamopali Maha Nikaya of the Mahavihara AncestryI am sending this message of greetings with great pleasure in the moment which the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is celebrating its 69th independence day.Independence is wholly a practical process. The independence becomes meaningful when we gain the economic and social freedom. Countries that have gained independence with us and after us have developed into a higher level with exercising this practical process. Social Analysts say that the independence of Sri Lanka has not become practical as it is a bestowed one rather than a gained one.Sri Lankan laic and ascetic leaders have created the environment needed to implement the independent struggle without any racial, religious and caste separation and with the clamorous situation in the country English rulers had to name Sri Lanka as an Independent Nation but their objective was to keep Sri Lankans as a divided nation.Psychological slavery and racist conceptions in Sri Lankan society are a great obstruction to the society. We would not be free from the western slavery until we are liberated form psychological slavery. However, it is a duty of all Sri Lankans to commemorate all ascetic and laic leaders who led the struggle for independence.I wish in this Independence Day that all could fulfil their obligations to themselves, their families, their religion, their country and their nation by in national and religious reconciliation and deviating from narrow politics. Most Ven. Warakagoda Dhammasiddhi Sri Pagngnananda Gnanarathana TheroMessage of Greetings by Archbishop of ColomboIn this moment which Sri Lanka is celebrating their 69th Independence Day, a great opportunity has occurred to recall the past for creating a better future. There was the responsibility to convert the political independence, which was won through facing various challenges in 1948, into an economic and social freedom for past 69 years. But unfortunately we were engaged in a war that destroyed a large number of lives and properties as the political field is polluted with narrow racial and religious separations and we all have suffered throughout the war. Narrow racial and communal attitudes are not the way to experience the true independence. All should unite as citizens with equal rights to gain the true independence. We should create an atmosphere that enjoys the unity within diversity and that protects needs and self-esteem of all citizens. It is a pleasure that the government led by H.E. the President is heading towards that direction. However, all political parties and opinion should be united to achieve this goal. It could not be gained alone.Moreover, it is our duty to search for the true independence that protects the culture and civilization of this country by freeing from neo-colonial and globalization trends. Let us affirm and commit to achieve this aim in this esteemed day. Hail mother Sri Lanka!Most Excellent Rev. Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith Message from the Ramakrishna MissionAs we all know that we are celebrating our 69th independence day, which is an auspicious occasion for all the Sri Lankan citizens. It is the day when Sri Lanka got freedom from the British rule after many years of hard struggle by the great freedom fighters of Sri Lanka.This day is of great importance to all Sri Lankan citizens as it gives opportunity to remember all those freedom fighters who had sacrificed their lives just for giving us beautiful, peaceful and happy life. Freedom is inseparable from responsibility.Every citizen of Sri Lanka should rededicate and take an oath today, of being highly responsible and well-educated citizens of the tomorrows Sri Lanka. Everyone should sincerely perform his/her duty and do work hard to get the nations goals fulfilled and successfully lead this democratic nation.Sri Lankas rise will be measured by the strength of the religious and cultural values, but it will equally be determined by the economic growth and equitable distribution of the nations resources.If we have the freedom to think, it is everyones responsibility to think positively. If we have the freedom to speak, it is our responsibility to speak properly and meaningfully. If we have the freedom to act, it is our responsibility to act correctly. If every Sri Lankan could feel responsible in that way, Sri Lanka would be growing more and more in the right direction, then it will be a better place for everyone.On this happy occasion, I pray to the Lord to shower His choicest blessings on H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, all their Cabinet collogues, Parliamentarians and all the people of Sri Lanka to live with peace, prosperity and happiness.Message from Rt. Rev. Dhiloraj R.Canagasabey, Bishop of ColomboThe church of Ceylon joins fellow Sri Lankans from all communities and faith groups to greet the nation and to wish our people a happier and better future as we mark our 69th year of independence.Since 1948, we have travelled a goodly distance as a nation, progressing in many areas such as health, access to primary and secondary education, life expectancy, equality of opportunity and poverty alleviation for example. We have also made commendable gains. In economic and infrastructure development, in addressing income inequalities, in higher education, although our progress in these areas has been much below our potential.It is where we have gone wrong and even regressed that has led us to the present moral crisis the country faces.Indiscipline, dishonesty, corruption, the hunger power, position and easy riches, the breakdown of the rule of low, mistrust, animosity between various ethnic groups and even the deliberate stoking of racial and religious hatred, these are the moral and ethical faults or sins which have gradually sapped and devastated the nation from within.Merely wishing or praying for prosperity and peace does not bring them about. There is a sacred duty cast on all of us, the rulers first and foremost but also on all our citizens to work honestly, sincerely and with dedication to create that country in which we could all live with pride, that Nation the dear homeland of us all.In the words of that great lover of Sri Lanka Rev.W.S. Senior of trinity College.But most shall he sing of LankaIn the bright new days that come,When the races all have blendedAnd the voice of strife is dumbWhen we leap to a single bugle,March to a single drum.To realize this vision, may we all dedicate ourselves this Independence Day.Message from all Ceylon Jamiyyathul UlamaThe all Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama has the pleasure in releasing this message of blessings to all citizens of the country on the day of celebrating the 69th Independence Day of our motherland, Sri Lanka.Let us all unite to eliminate racism from our beautiful country.

The epochal mission carried out by the countrymen as one nation to liberate the country from the yoke of colonization, which had been our fate for centuries, and to build a sovereign country should be commemorated.However, we should ask ourselves whether we have been successful in our effort to maintain the unity, which we had proved during the struggle for independence. We are still struggling with a number of issues for which we should find sustainable solutions as one nation even after lapse 69 years from the independence. The poverty emerges as one of the main issues. Building a concrete trust among nationalities, formulation of national policies for sustainable development as well as establishment of reconciliation within the country are the important matters, which demand priority. Even under such challenges, still there are certain aspects regarding which we can be satisfied. Today, the two main political parties of the country have set a good example leaving behind their different political views and working together in one and the same mission for the progress of the country. The government, which was elected in order to alleviate poverty, the major issue of the country, has declared this year as the year of alleviating poverty. Therefore, this year will open avenues to provide long lasting solutions to several burning issues of the country. At this juncture, it is a great achievement that we could win significant democratic rights within a short period such as the right to information and the right to express ideas for the wellbeing of the country and people.The reality we should understand correctly as a country is that the capability of our nation depends on the unity of all nationalities devoid of political divisions and the unity is the only mean through which we can face all the challenges successfully. The example given by the political authority should be followed by all nationalities in our country. The first condition of our effort to make the mission a success is the unity among people.

The example given by the political authority should be followed by all nationalities in our country. The first condition of our effort to make the mission a success is the unity among people. Therefore, we must understand that any split means the destruction of the country. If we need to emerge as a proud nation, we should make every effort to step forward as one nation. Therefore, at this remarkable juncture where Sri Lanka celebrates the 69th Independence Day, I take this opportunity to wish the Sri Lankan nation courage and vision to build our country ensuring mutual respect and safeguarding the dignity of country.

I am very pleased with this occasion to hold this 69th independence celebration with high dignity, pride and glory.When we celebrate the freedom, we should talk about what the real freedom is. As far as I know more than 6000 languages are spoken by various nationalities living in the countries across the world. In all those languages the word independence is considered as a significant, incomparable and unconquerable word.There is a difference between the ideas come into minds when we talk about the freedom during the time our country has been under foreign invaders from 1505 to 1948 and the freedom in the current era. In 1948 D. S. Senanayake and contemporary national leaders who represented all communities; Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim gave a giant strength to the national struggle for freedom.During that struggle, there were occasions when our national leaders were imprisoned. Thousands sacrificed their lives for the country and the freedom from 1505 to 1948. On this Independence Day we should remember the sweet fragrance of the noble sacrifices made by the heroes in that historic era who sacrificed their lives and shed their blood in the fight against colonial rulers.During the decades of 1930 and 1940, as a result of the demands made by the leaders of this country, we got rid of some major grievances through the Donoughmore and Solbary Commissions. We succeeded in winning the freedom on the 4th of February 1948.When we talk about the freedom it is essential to remember the valiant war heroes who fought to save our country from L. T. T. E. terrorism throughout 30 years. They sacrificed their lives. They lost their limbs. They became disabled and their families suffered heavily. Economy was ruined. About 100,000 people including civilians lost their lives. Thousands became disabled. Are the people who lost their lives in the 30 years long war were losers? Are those who saved their lives are winners? I believe that we, who saved our lives from that tragedy, should remember the lessons we learnt.Today we talk about freedom in a more complex manner than it was discussed in the past. All of us know, at present when we talk about freedom primarily, we talk about a freedom blowing across the sky, including our human freedom, media freedom, the right to expression, right to thought and the right to assemble.In the process of building our great Motherland as a modern state which is compatible with the twenty-first century, we have to work, giving priority to the political stability and the social development. All of you know that to achieve those goals, it is necessary to strengthen the national as well as religious reconciliation in the country. Specifically, I have to mention that we, as a Government, have given priority in this regard.I clearly state that even though we receive accolades from locally and internationally for our commitment and determination to establish national reconciliation and peace in the country, there are some opportunistic elements who act against those noble efforts of the Government. I describe those opportunist forces as a section of society who acts against the country.Today, all of us should commit ourselves to ensure the economic freedom of our country, when we define the word freedom. The knowledge and the ability of the intellectuals and scholars in the country, innovative skills and capabilities, and the efficiency of the skilled workforce as well as the strength of labour of all the people including the farmers and workers plus their commitment is essential to gain economic freedom to our country.I believe this era as a period where our new generation is extremely interested in obtaining knowledge and the skills in the field of the high technology. I must mention that always as a Government we are giving priority to provide requisite guidance to our young generation to acquire new knowledge to conquer the world also to build this country based on the concept of the knowledge economy.All of us agreed that to ensure full democracy in the country in this 21st Century, first we should achieve the economic prosperity. In that context, we give priority to our new generation. I should specially mention here the inheritors and custodians in the process of building an innovative economy based on the knowledge, is our young generation.I request all the intellectuals and academics in the country to give their contribution in providing guidance to our young generation in associating all different economic processes, concepts like knowledge economy, innovative economy, green economy, digital economy, oceans economy into our national economy.

All of you know we declare the year 2017 as a year that the country will be freed from poverty.We expect the commitment and the sacrifices of all the public and the intellectuals, academics, politicians, public officials in implementing national sustainable development policies and strategies and freeing the country from poverty. I believe everyone will fulfill their respective duties in achieving noble national goals.We are a strong, talented and efficient nation. People in our country are educated and intelligent. Therefore, we should accept that we have that knowledge, resources and ability to move forward as a nation. I request all of you to unite to build our nation.Everybody acknowledges the imperative need for eliminating corruption, bribery, malpractices, waste and fraud. It is essential for the politicians and public servants to work honestly and with commitment.When we attempt to achieve economic prosperity, it is essential for the politician to be a character of honesty and commitment. Furthermore I trust the politicians and public servants fulfill the responsibilities and duties honestly and with commitment to build the Motherland.When we talk about political science and economic theories, there are strengths and weaknesses in social democracy and market economy.

Rauf Hakeem, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Sri Lanka, H.E. Chang, Won-sam and other dignitaries.This project is supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) with the aim of providing clean and safe drinking water to the people in Mahawa and Polpithigama divisions located towards the Northern part of Kurunegala district as these area are reportedly inflicted with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).The rapid spread of CKD has become a menace in Sri Lanka while Kurunegala district has been identified by health authorities as a severely affected area. The main reason for the spread of CKD is the consumption of unsafe ground water which is caused by the lack of piped water coverage in the larger Kurunegala district. Given these circumstances, the government of Sri Lanka aims to take measures to address the prevalence of CKD under the patronage of President Sirisena. In line with the governments plan to prevent this debilitating disease, Korea Eximbank expects to provide safe drinking water for residents in Mahawa and Polpithigama divisional secretarys divisions that are located towards the Northern part of Kurunegala district. Through this project, piped water will be provided to 18,200 households thereby benefiting 90,800 residents.The scope of this much anticipated project includes building comprehensive water supply facilities such as intake structure, water treatment plant, water transmission lines, water storage reservoirs and water distribution network. Furthermore, institutional capacities will be developed to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of these facilities. Upon successful project completion in mid-2019, Korea Eximbank expects that it will contribute to decrease the incidence of CKD and water-borne diseases as well as to improve the health environment and living conditions in the region.

It is the day Shiva was married to the goddess Parvati.Mahashivaratri Festival or the The Night of Shiva is celebrated with devotion and religious fervor in honor of Lord Shiva, one of the deities of Hindu Trinity. Shivaratri falls on the moonless 14th night of the new moon in the Hindu month of Phalgun, which corresponds to the month of February - March in English Calendar. Celebrating the festival of Shivaratri devotees observe day and night fast and perform ritual worship of Shiva Lingam to appease Lord Shiva.There are various interesting legends related to the festival of Maha Shivaratri. According to one of the most popular legends, Shivaratri marks the wedding day of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Some believe that it was on the auspicious night of Shivaratri that Lord Shiva performed the Tandava, the dance of the primal creation, preservation and destruction. Another popular Shivratri legend stated in Linga Purana states that it was on Shivaratri that Lord Shiva manifested himself in the form of a Linga. Hence the day is considered to be extremely auspicious by Shiva devotees and they celebrate it as Mahashivaratri - the grand night of Shiva.Various traditions and customs related to Shivaratri Festival are dutifully followed by the worshippers of Lord Shiva. Devotees observe strict fast in honor of Shiva, though many go on a diet of fruits and milk some do not consume even a drop of water. Devotees strongly believe that sincere worship of Lord Shiva on the auspicious day of Shivaratri, absolves a person of sins and liberates him from the cycle of birth and death. Shivaratri is considered especially auspicious for women. While married women pray for the well being of their husbands unmarried women pray for a husband like Lord Shiva, who is regarded as the ideal husband.To mark the Shivratri festival, devotees wake up early and take a ritual bath, preferably in river Ganga. After wearing fresh new clothes devotees visit the nearest Shiva temple to give ritual bath to the Shiva Lingum with milk, honey, water etc.On Shivaratri, worship of Lord Shiva continues all through the day and night. Every three hours priests perform ritual pooja of Shivalingam by bathing it with milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, sugar and water amidst the chanting of Om Namah Shivaya and ringing of temple bells. Nightlong vigil or jaagran is also observed in Shiva temples where large number of devotees spend the night singing hymns and devotional songs in praise of Lord Shiva.

In the next Yala minor season, there is expected to be normal rainfall in the Wet zone in the Dry and Intermediate zones rainfall will be low as usual, the Agro-climatology & Climate Change Division of Sri Lanka's Department of Agriculture said.Due to the lagging effect of last year's drought, irrigation tanks are low in water and it was unlikely that they will get enough water to reach capacity in the next two months.\"Therefore, it is highly advisable to grow short-age crops and varieties during Yala 2017 season in the Dry and Intermediate zones,\" the Department of Agriculture said in a weather update.\"In paddy fields, priority should be given to 2.5-months paddy varieties.\"In field that tend to dry up quickly other field crops like green gram, black gram cow-pea, sesame and vegetables should be grown, the department said.In Sri Lanka's Wet zone covering the South Western area, rice could be grown widely.\"It is likely that Wet zone of the country will continue to receive substantial amount of rains from mid-March onwards and therefore, every possible actions should be taken to bring a maximum possible extent of paddy lands to cultivation from this climatic zone,\" the statement said.On average it takes about 1,400 liters of rice to produce a kilogram of rice, especially in East Asia.But depending on the yield and the condition of the field which soak up water it may take up to 3500 to 4000 liters of water to produce a kilo of rice. Unlike other crops, rice is grown in flooded conditions.The warning is coming as the main Maha cultivation season is ending, with up to 137,000 hectares of paddy fields hit by drought.The Department of Agriculture tried to discourage farmers in areas where water shortages were forecasted last year, so that they could earn some income from an alternative crop.But officials said many farmers did not heed their advice, partly due to a faith that rains would eventually come, and partly because they wanted the security of having a store of rice.Rice production in Sri Lanka's main Maha cultivation season is expected to be sharply down in 2017, with lower output also in the Yala season despite normal rainfall being predicted, for this year.

The prime objective of this program is to ensure the proper implementation of all the development projects proposed by Budget 2017 in time.The Ministry of Finance has summarized in a report to all ministry secretaries about the projects coming under the purview of each ministry and, how such projects proposed by the budget are implemented. This report also includes details with regard to new laws to be introduced if necessary.The report has further advised ministry secretaries to prepare an action plan and implement all the projects and proposals made by the budget within this year in order to eradicate poverty, generate employment enabling the public to increase their income.Budget 2017 has proposed 325 projects to be implemented and, National Budget Department has allocated necessary funds for each ministry to implement them hassle free.Accordingly, Treasury Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga has already informed ministry secretaries to prepare procurement plans and action plans with immediate effect and submit them to the Director General Budget Department to enable him to provide necessary grants for each project.Certain budget proposals were implemented with effect from the very midnight following the budget was presented to parliament and the responsibility of implementing the balance is left with the respective ministries and their regulatory bodies.Accordingly, prices of several essential commodities including kerosene, sugar, canned fish and powdered milk have already been dropped.Relevant Acts and regulations introduced under a move to simplifytax system will be implemented with effect from 01.04.2017. The specific feature in preparing budget this time is that the inclusion of proposals by people from all walks of life including ordinary people, businessmen and professionals. Tourism has been bouncing back in the country and a group of businessmen engaged in transporting tourists requested assistance to improve the sector. Accordingly, new regulations with regard to leasing loans for vehicles will not be applied to transport service providers in the tourism sector. They will be able to enjoy 100% loan facilities to lease out vehicles. At the same time, university scholars who brought forward research details pointed out the need for a regulatory body with regard to three wheelers. Budget 2017 which welcomed the argument by university experts has proposed new regulations in leasing out three wheelers. Accordingly, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake proposed in Budget 2017 that loan to value ratio should be 25% for three wheelers, 50% for motor cars and vans and 90% for lorries and buses.Therefore, Central Bank of Sri Lanka has advised commercial banks and leasing companies to follow new regulations in granting loans for vehicle leasing including three wheelers.Currently, loans can be borrowed after paying 10% of the total value of a three wheelerwhich a borrower intends to buy. In the future, under the new leasing regulations, 25% of the total value of a three wheeler should be paid instead. Proposed traffic laws and spot fines are scheduled to be revised in the near future and the Finance Ministry believes that the new regulations imposed on loans will make an impact on leasing out of three wheelers.325 projects have been proposed to be implemented within this year.

But, I must say that this is only a pipe dream he added.He also identified the abolition of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which gave extraordinary powers to the President as a bigger victory than the passing of the 19th amendment which pruned the powers of the Executive President.The President went on to say It was vital to nullify the 18th Amendment than passing the 19th amendment to the Constitution as it is of paramount importantance to safeguard democracy, he said.The President while speaking on the action plan of the country especially in the economic development sector, said the country will be subjected to a radical changes in several key fields. Speaking on the moves to agriculture sector development, President Sirisena said that it has been planned to renovate all small tanks including channel system.However, the present unity government is being praised by many world leaders at various occasions. As a result of the democratic and people-friendly good-governance existing in the country, many challenges could be overcome and moreover the country is being widely accepted in the international arena especially at international forums. The country has achieved a significant progress in the spheres of protecting and safeguarding human rights, strengthening democracy, media freedom, freeing the judiciary system from the clutches of politics and many more positive achievements in various sectors as described in the election manifesto, the President said.As a consequence of the failure to protect human rights, inability to face the economic crisis and failure to build up ethnic harmony was the very reason for the former government to dissolve it two years before the due period, President Sirisena said.The bad economic management of the then government, there is a liability of Rs 9,000,000 million to be settled by this government, the President said.Certain people tend to ask what this government has done during the last two years. I must say that this government has laid the foundation for democracy, freedom, ethnic harmony, achieving economic freedom and many more positive moves. Unlike the previous regime, no journalist was killed on the road or no one left the country for death fear to save the life. This is how everyone is experiencing media freedom, established by this government during the last two year period. Despite the fact that a mountain of loan amounting Rs. 9,000,000 million to be settled, several key development projects are being carried out. Even though, illuminated development projects are not carried out by this government, the economy of the country is gradually strengthening, the President said.The President said that the opposition is spreading falsehoods saying that the new constitution will divide the country and that Buddhism will lose its pre-eminent position. He appealed to these elements not to indulge in scaremongering and said that he will never change the unitary character of the country. He appealed to the doubters in his midst and also the opponents, not to give importance to their electoral fortunes but concentrate on putting the country back on its feet by supporting the government.No need to talk about toppling the government.

This new volume has enabled the Port of Colombo to register overall incremental growth in the three consecutive years since CICT came into operation, the company said.Announcing the milestone achievement, CICT said ULCCs (Ultra Large Container Carriers) and VLCCs (Very large Container Carriers), many of a size that only the Colombo South Terminal is capable of handling, had contributed 70% to the volumes it achieved in 2016.The incremental volume handled by CICT was one of the contributors to the overall throughput of the Port of Colombo growing by an estimated 11% in 2016, the company said. CICT is the first and currently the only deep water terminal in South Asia equipped with facilities to handle the largest vessels afloat.The overall growth achieved by the Port of Colombo bears out the rationale for CICTs successful operation, CICT CEO Mr. Ray Ren said. We are delighted with the new business CICT has attracted to the Port of Colombo in 2016, and proud of our contribution to the overall growth achieved by the Port.CICT General Manager  Commercial and Marketing Mr. TissaWickramasinghe added: It must be emphasised that this historic achievement of two million teus was made possible mainly by the synergies developed through our parent company China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH).The ability to access the CMPH global network was the key factor in gaining and attracting new transhipment volumes to the Port of Colombo. With the introduction of new services and new shipping lines, CICT has set the trend for the Port of Colombo to stave off international competition for the highly sensitive and volatile transhipment cargo, in a depleted global shipping market.In 2015, its first full year of operation, CICT 2015 handled 1.561 million teus, with the ULCC and VLCC segments making a 67% contribution to this volume. The benefit of these mega carriers calling at the port cascades down to the other terminals and reinforces Colombos status as a major transhipment hub.Over the past two years, CICT has brought some of the largest vessels plying the Asia-Europe routes to Colombo. Of these, MSC Maya at 19,224 TEU the worlds largest container vessel, the MV Mogens Maersk (18,300 TEU), MSC New York (16,652 TEU), CMA CGM Marco Polo (16,020 TEU), YML YM Wondrous, Edith Maersk and EMC Thalassa Hellas (each 14,000 plus TEUs) and their sister vessels are now regular callers at CICT.Besides its significant contributions to the growth of the Port of Colombo in volume terms, CICT is also responsible for several firsts in service innovation and eco-friendly operations. In early 2016, the company launched a $ 10 million programme to convert its fleet of diesel operated rubber-tyred-gantry cranes to electricity driven rubber-tyred gantry cranes (E-RTGs) which have zero carbon emissions.CICT was also the first terminal in the Port of Colombo to introduce electronic boat notes, breaking new ground in efforts to reduce paper in export documentation, as well as the first to launch a mobile app for the purpose of keeping track of containerised cargo at the terminal.The concluded year also saw CICT winning the prestigious Highly Commended award in the Port Operator category at Lloyds List Middle East and Indian Subcontinent Awards, and being cited as one of the factors in its parent company  China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH)  being adjudged Port Operator of the Year at the Lloyds List 2016 Global Awards.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/572-cict-surpasses-2million-teu-milestone", "title": "CICT surpasses 2million TEU milestone"},

Accordingly for the 2016 Sri lankan minister of finance Ravi Karunanayake has been selected as the Finance minister of the year 2016 award.The Banker says Karunanayake secured a $ 1.5 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program that the country needed to avoid a balance of payments crisis, replenish reserves and rebuild confidence among international investors.Sri Lankas latest bond issues in the international capital markets suggest Karunanayake has indeed reached his objective. In 2015, the sovereign issued a $ 1.5 billion dual-tranche note  its largest since 2007. A year later, it printed a second bond of the same size, with order books of $ 6.6 billion, despite market volatility after the UK voted to leave the EU.Sri Lanka is also working towards fiscal consolidation. Sri Lankas budget deficit has dropped from 7% when Karunanayake took office in January 2015 to 5.4% in 2016  below the targeted expectations of 5.6%.After a visit in September 2016, the IMF said Sri Lankas tightening of fiscal and monetary policies has been effective and that it met the IMF programs targets through to the end of June 2016.According to latest Sri Lankas total government revenue grew from Rs. 1205 in 2014 to Rs. 1,461 billion in 2015. Tax revenue rose from Rs. 1,050 billion to Rs. 1,356 billion in the same period. This is crucial for Sri Lanka, which has a very low tax revenue-to-gross domestic product ratio.To raise tax revenue further, Parliament passed a bill to increase value-added tax from 11% to 15%. Karunanayake is also keen to continue simplifying the tax system as well as change peoples mindset towards taxes. But even without expected revenue from the increased VAT due to its late implementation the Finance ministry was able to increase the national revenue to 13.5% the GDP in 2016 from 11.4% in 2014 thus making it possible to cover the recurrent expenditure.The Gout inculcated in the minds of the people that paying taxes is not something bad, but a must for the country. Every person needs to pay a reasonable charge instead of relying on the Government for everything. As a result, Sri Lankas tax records have grown from having 700,000 files in January 2015 to having 1.4 million today.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/474-banker-magazine-picks-ravi-k-as-finance-minister-of-the-year-asia-pacific-2016", "title": "Banker Magazine picks Ravi K as Finance Minister of the Year, Asia-Pacific 2016"},

In a statement today the European Commission said, The European Commission today proposed that a significant part of the remaining import duties on Sri Lankan products should be removed by the European Union in exchange for countrys commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.These one-way trade preferences would consist of the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries, the statement further said.It quoted Trade Commissioner Cecelia Malmstrm as saying  GSP+ preferences can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing exports to the EU market. But this also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms. I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process. This should include making Sri Lankan counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights conventions.It also added that Granting access to the GSP+ scheme does not mean that the situation of the beneficiary country with respect to the 27 international conventions is fully satisfactory. Instead, it offers the incentive of increased trade access in return for further progress towards the full implementations of those conventions, and provides a platform for engagement with beneficiaries on all problematic areas.As is the case with all GSP+ countries, the removal of customs duties for Sri Lanka would be accompanied with the rigorous monitoring on the countrys progress in the area of sustainable development, human rights and good governance.

{"date": "January 26, 2017", "text": "The total debt stock of Sri Lanka has gone up by 233% to Rs.7, 391 billion during the period from 2005 to 2014. The total debt burden of Sri Lanka in 2005 was Rs.2, 222 billion and, within 5 years, it increased up to Rs.4, 590 billion in 2010. In addition there is another Rs 2,000 billion debt obtained by the Public owned Enterprises directly off the balance sheet.Accordingly, the debt servicing (loan installments and the interest) to be paid by Sri Lanka to foreign financiers is also increasing constantly. The debt servicing of US$ 1,828 million paid in 2016 will be increased by more than double to US$3,992 million being the highest debt repayment to be paid by Sri Lanka in a year due to colossal borrowings by the previous government. This could be considered as the highest sum of debt servicing to be repaid by Independent Sri Lanka within a year.According to Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Sri Lanka is embroiled in a gigantic debt trap. The main reason is that the loans obtained by the previous regime for infrastructure development has not brought any returns on its investments. Further the national revenue and the export earnings constantly came down since 2011 up to year 2014.Developed countries use their own resources to build mega size infrastructure facilities such as ports and airports. Developing countries tent invite foreign investors to build such huge projects instead as their economies cannot afford the high cost of large scale projects. Alternatively, foreign investors are invited to construct such infrastructure under Build, Operate and Transfer basis or Build, Own and Operate called BOO/BOT basis as in such an instance the developing countries need not bear the burden of debt repayment .Sri Lanka also in the past eveloped telecommunication system in the island on BOO/BOT basis. While it enables investors to regain dividends for the investment during a given time and, simultaneously, it does not make developing countries to pass the burden of investment on its poor citizens.Before launching mega projects of Ports, Airports and Express ways, there were unsolicited proposals to build Hambantota Port, Mattala Airport and southern express ways which could be easily carried out on BOO/BOT basis during the previous regime. But, unfortunately, the former regime opted to borrow unprecedentedly to build them. Consequently, Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport became loss making entities while leaving the country and people in an unbearable debt trap.The previous government had obtained US$1,303 million for the Hambantota Port and the first phase of the credit of Rs.340 million was released on a 6% interest. In addition, 6% insurance premium should also be paid for the loan. Another US$ 4.5 billion had been obtained through International Sovereign Bond during the period between 2010 and 2014. This sovereign bond should be repaid in full as one billion dollar per annum from its maturity in 2019. However, the repayment of all these project loans and bonds began after 2014. Although the country or its people receive no dividends from these Port and Air Port projects built on foreign loans by the previous regime, the current government has been compelled to repay installments and interest for such loans with effect from 2015 though they do run at a loss.Accordingly, Sri Lanka is compelled to make the repayment on foreign loans as follows:Total amount paid in 2014 - US$ 1,442 millionTotal amount paid in 2015 - US$ 2,031 millionTotal amount paid in 2016 - US$ 1,828 millionTotal amount should be paid in 2017 - US$ 2,417 millionTotal amount should be paid in 2018 - US$ 2,564 millionTotal amount should be paid in 2019 - US$ 3,992 millionTotal amount should be paid in 2020 - US$ 3,463 million.This debt repayment covers only the project loans and the International sovereign bond. The liability on the loan obtained from the IMF and the investment by foreigners on the treasury bills and treasury bonds is to be paid separately.Its unfortunate that the previous government did not have any strategy to turn such giant loss making entities in to profit making ventures. Therefore, the current government has made arrangements to convert these credits in to equity under the Public Private Partnership concept thereby relieving the people from the debt burden. While the government is taking untiring efforts to convert these white elephants into profit making institutions, and generate income and employment for the youth in the country, an opposition group is engaged in sabotaging such efforts charging that the government is attempting to sell off national resources to foreigners. It is high time people thought rationally in response to such misleading remarks made by these rival groups.At the same time, people should ask the opposition who make an abortive attempt to jeopardize the well being of the people to show some avenues to generate income for the country to repay the massive loans accumulated by 2019 which were obtained by the previous government.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the current government is engaged in a mission to bring investment to the country thereby generating employment and income to the country. He said that will save the country from the existing foreign debt burden. Therefore, Minister Karunanayake said that for no reason, opportunists will be allowed to sabotage the ongoing development operation by the current government.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/546-sri-lanka-s-highest-foreign-debt-repayment-of-us-d-4000-million-due-in-2019", "title": "Sri Lankas highest foreign debt repayment of US D 4000 million due in 2019"},

I look forward to strengthening cooperation between the EIB and Sri Lanka in the years to come. confirmed Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance of Sri Lanka following his meeting in Brussels with senior European Investment Bank officials responsible for lending in South Asia.Increased access to sanitation to be achieved by this project will improve the lives of thousands of people living in Colombo and contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals in Sri Lanka. The European Investment Bank is pleased to be working closely with partners in Sri Lanka to ensure an environmentally sustainable future for the countrys capital and is grateful for the excellent cooperation with the Asian Development Bank in our first joint support in the country.The fruitful discussions with Ministers Karunanayake and Samarawickrama have outlined how the EIBs global experience can support new investment to improve lives and enhance opportunities in Sri Lanka. said Andrew McDowell, European Investment Bank Vice President.\"This loan is a further example of the European Union's support for Sri Lanka's long-term development. Studies show that modern sanitation is one of the most important factors in people's health and well-being. In addition, water supplies in many developing countries are under growing pressure from urbanisation and climate change, which puts a premium on the efficient use of those resources. We are pleased to provide assistance to help address these challenges and improve access to water and sanitation for the people of Colombo,\" said Tung-La Margue, European Union Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.The 25 year long-term was formally agreed at a signature ceremony in Brussels by Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade of Sri Lanka and Andrew McDowell, European Investment Bank Vice President responsible for lending operations in South Asia.

Large percentage of state revenue is from the income taxes which has increased to Rs 1067 billion from Rs 882 billion on Year on Year basis within the first nine months of this year During the last few years due to increased heavy public debt the revenue gradually came down to an average of 11 percent of the GDP in 2014.

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "A goldmine of ideas to convert Police into a people friendly law and order maintenance machinery emerged at the international conference Future Policing: Prospects and Challenges for South Asia held in Colombo to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Sri Lanka Police.The conference, which was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, was organized jointly by the National Police Commission (NPC) and the Colombo-based South Asian think-tank, Regional Centre for Strategic Studies (RCSS) and the Police in collaboration with the United Nations.The three-day conference, which concluded on 6 October, discussed the South Asian policing methods and suggested steps needed to make reforms in the Police service while identifying the common issues in the region and understanding the diversity among them.Post-conflict societyPromising to implement major reforms, IGP Jayasundara said a dynamic post-conflict society in Sri Lanka demands qualitatively and quantitative modernized Police, with a democratic outlook and commitment towards its responsibilities and accountability under the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Human Rights form the basis for Sri Lanka Police service which is legally and morally bound to serve and protect the people, he said.The IGP said the forum discussed a broad range of themes that are of great importance to South Asian countries such as Oversight and Accountability, Community Policing, Technology and Policing, Gender and Policing, Child Protection, Terrorism and Human Rights and Environment and Policing.He said the proposals emerged at the conference would lead to formulate a South Asian model to policing in the region, which can be adopted to better suit the diversities and norms of the nations. Experts and Police officers from 21 countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Australia, Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan and officials from INTERPOL as well as scholars and experts who have research and practical experience on policing in South Asia attended the conference.Democratic policingNPC Chairman Prof. Siri Hettige, in his speech referred to democratic policing and the imperative need to transform the Police to be a key player in the State mechanism that protects Human Rights, maintains order and guarantees stability.During the deliberations, many important issues were discussed. The experts pointed out that the Police have the powers to arrest and detain and to use force, placing the Police in a unique and sensitive position within the democratic State. Police will enhance the legitimacy of the State if it is responsive to public needs and expectations; and use the authority of the State in the peoples interest and the Police are the most visible manifestation of government authority.There is an urgent requirement for Police reforms as policing in Sri Lanka continues to be governed by the Police Ordinance of 1861 still relying on colonial policing laws and structures despite political independence of the country more than 60 years ago and the introduction of various democratic institutions.Colonial economyInitially, the Police force was established to protect the establishment ie. the colonial order, colonial economy and other interests. The British model defined Police constable as not the servant of anyone, saviour of the law itself, responsibility for law enforcement lies on him. He is answerable to the law and to the law alone. (Lord Denning)The duties of the Police include maintenance of public tranquility and law and order, protect and respect the individuals fundamental rights and freedoms, prevent and combat crime and provide assistance and services to the public.Social developmentPolicing in a modern State has to be both fair and effective for economic and social development of the country and the role of policing in todays context is diverse and complex. It is vital to build good community relations, enhance professionalism by using modern technology and employing new operational tactics and focusing on crime  a growing threat to societies in the 21st century.United Nations recognizes policing as a vital component of broader security which is critical to prevent conflict, contribute to peacebuilding and to ensure safety and security for sustainable development. All these have enormous impacts on the State, economy and development. 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development recognize 17 SDGs of which policing is also critically important to create a sense of security.Sustainable developmentAnother aspect is that Sri Lanka aims to achieve sustainable development for which a vital requirement is both domestic and foreign investments. To attract investors peace and stability are essential pre-requisites. Hence maintaining law and order and rule of law is essential. Role of policing is rapidly going beyond traditional / limited maintenance of law and order and prevention and detection of crime to include new roles of protecting human rights, disaster management, protection of environmental resources, ecotourism, and biodiversity conservation.Though situation changed with arrival of peace and the Police service gradually shifted from security form of policing to community oriented policing, process is taking place at a slow pace. Powers of independent Commissions, including National Police Commission, established as oversight bodies in 2001 short-lived with the 18th Amendment, Police analysts pointed out at the conference. However, they were reinstituted under the 19 A.The drawbacks include limited resource and organizational weakness that constrain the effective and efficient deployment of available personnel both functionally and territorially.Community policing In recent years, community policing has emerged as a major strategy of policing to make the Police more effective at crime prevention and control. Yet, the experts lamented that the transition is slow due to diverse circumstances.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/200-from-wartime-to-peace-transition-of-policing", "title": "From wartime to peace, Transition of Policing"},

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Eng. Karunasena Hettiarachchi who in China attending the 7th Xiangshan Forum in Beijing was among the distinguished speakers of the second plenary session on Tuesday (11th September 2016).Making his speech during the second plenary session on \"The Role of Militaries in Global Governance' Secretary Hettiarachchi said, that Asia is home to three of the world's nuclear powers and is a space of constant reconfigurations of political and security alignment since British decolonization. The global political and economic balance of power is undergoing major shifts with the rise of the Asian economies and the re-emergence to prominence of the Indian Ocean in global developments and trade. The dramatic changes that have occurred in the scope of international connectivity in the second half of the 21st century, has led to monumental changes in the intensity, speed and volume of global interactions and significantly increased global interdependence not only among states but also a number of non-state actors that have become key stakeholders of global governance.Further speaking he said, the proliferation of stakeholders has led to the creation of a new architecture of global governance that has moved from a state-centric model to embrace complex interactions among states, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), and non-state actors, ushering in an age of global partnerships. In this backdrop, militaries across the globe are adjusting to new strategic realities and their role in global governance is being constantly reinvented. The role of militaries in global governance is being evolved not only to counter traditional and non-traditional security threats but also to proactively contribute to Human Security, he added.Secretary Hettiarachchi went on to say that with the change of government in January 2015 Sri Lanka reaffirmed its adherence to a policy of non-alignment with an emphasis on building positive relations with all States. Sri Lanka is committed to countering security threats in the region and looks forward to working together with its partners and friends in the region and beyond to find innovative and collaborative ways in which to meet these challenges.Speaking on the concept of civil-military cooperation he said that in Sri Lanka, the role of the military is evolving with the changes that have taken place in the internal security environment of the country since the defeat of terrorism in 2009. Particularly in the immediate post conflict phase the military was used to deliver assistance in the North and East where civilian administration needed assistance. Gradually the military was removed from involvement in civilian administration in these areas. It has become evident however, that in some cases the Armed Forces have the capacity and capability of delivering quick assistance on matters of national importance where civilian administration is gathering momentum in its delivery capability and being a developing country with resource constraints Sri Lanka needs to avail itself of such assistance as and when requested and needed.While mentioning of the country's military involvement in development activities and disaster management and humanitarian response activities he mentioned the role of the Sri Lankan armed forces personnel in disaster management efforts in Maldives and Nepal.While speaking of Sri Lanka's involvement in UN Peacekeeping efforts he said that, President Maithripala Sirisena has reaffirmed of Sri Lanka's commitment to increase contribution to UN peacekeeping missions. Sri Lanka has contributed to peacekeeping missions in the Central African Republic, Western Sahara, Haiti, Lebanon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Darfur, Liberia, and South Sudan among others.He opined that the Indian Ocean is a region where the interests and influence of India, China and the United States has begun to overlap and intersect. In this realm, the role of small yet effective militaries such as that of Sri Lanka is important. Sri Lanka together with its partners also has responsibility to ensure the safety, security and livelihoods of the millions of people who inhabit the Indian Ocean littoral spaces and hinterlands. In this context building stronger cooperation in the maritime sphere and ensuring maritime safety and security is critical. The potential 'Soft Power' that Sri Lanka could wield considering our critical location in the Indian Ocean region is yet to be fully exploited.He was of the view that global governance needs to comprehensively address the issue of climate change, environmental degradation and man's growing ecological footprint. It is critical for governments to be alert at all times with regard to the ecological impact of military exercises and military operations.In conclusion the Secretary said that Sri Lanka is committed to high level dialogue with regions through platforms such as this to ensure a safe and prosperous future for its citizens and the world at large.The Xiangshan Forum , initiated by the China Association for Military Science (CAMS) in 2006 is a track 1.5 high-end dialogue platform on Asian Security and defense issues. The theme for this year is 'Build a New Type of International Relations through Security Dialogue and Cooperation' and the four topics for discussion at the plenary sessions are 'Role of Militaries in Global Governance', 'Responding to New Security Challenges in the Asia-Pacific through Cooperation', 'Maritime Security Cooperation' and 'International Terrorist Threats and Countermeasures'. This defence conclave is sponsored by Chinese Academy of Military Science and the China Institute for International Strategic Studies.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/202-secretary-speaks-at-xiangshan-forum", "title": "Secretary speaks at Xiangshan Forum"},

(Hilton Colombo, 9 November 2016) It is a pleasure to be here with you this morning, and I extend to all of you, a very warm welcome to Sri Lanka.I understand that this meeting brings together State representatives, representatives of transitional justice mechanisms, national human rights institutions, NGOs, victims groups, UN officials, and representatives of regional organizations from the Asia-Pacific region to discuss and share experiences on transitional justice processes in the region.I was informed that in accordance with the mandate given by the Human Rights Council to the Special Rapporteur, he was requested by the Council to gather relevant information on national situations, including on normative frameworks, national practices and experiences; identify, exchange and promote good practices and lessons learned; and recommend ways and means to improve and strengthen the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.Accordingly, regional consultations have so far been held for the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe and North America. The region of the Asia-Pacific is the last on the list.I feel that we are fortunate that by accident or by design, the consultations for the Asia-Pacific was kept to be done last, giving us this wonderful opportunity to welcome not only Mr. Pablo de Greif, but all of you, to Sri Lanka. As you all know, since the election of President Maithripala Sirisena in a historical Presidential election last January, Sri Lanka has embarked on a process of reconciliation. The two main political parties in Sri Lanka  the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by President Sirisena and the United National Party led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have come together to forge a Government of National Unity. This is a step that is unprecedented in our nations history. In the words of President Sirisena in his inaugural address to Parliament following the General Election last August, this was a necessary step to obtain the bipartisan consensus that is required to face the important challenges before our nation, which include reconciliation and peacebuilding.Therefore, Ladies and Genetlemen, this is an important moment in our history. We have acknowledged and recognised the need for reconciliation and the important contribution that transitional justice can make to this process of healing. Sri Lankas co-sponsorship of Resolution 30/1 titled Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka is a manifestation of our strong commitment to this process.Several initial steps in this long journey that we have embarked upon have been taken already. This includes the setting up, through an Act of Parliament, an Office on Missing Persons which is a component of the truth-seeking process. The legislation for this was enacted in August and the procedural steps for its establishment including the nomination of members by the Constitutional Council are now underway. A Task Force was appointed early this year, by the Government, comprising members of civil society, to hold public consultations, involving all stakeholders, to seek their views on the mechanisms for truth-seeking, justice and reparations. This important process of national consultations has just concluded and the Task Force is scheduled to hand over their report to the President and the Prime Minister, this month. The designing of the truth-seeking, justice and reparations mechanisms will be informed by the report of this Task Force.At the same time, we have undertaken a process of constitutional reform. A Resolution for the Parliament to sit as a Constitutional Assembly for this purpose was passed unanimously by our Parliament. The various drafting committees are presently at work.Ladies and Gentlemen,The processes that are underway here are in fact too numerous to list out and what I listed out are just a few.For this process in Sri Lanka to be successful, we have to also ensure that the people of our country receive a quick economic peace dividend, and this is also an area on which we are focusing significant attention at the moment.As contexts differ and there are no cookie-cutter models that can be adopted in sensitive processes such as transitional justice, this is a journey that our nation has to undertake and chart on its own. Yet, we cannot afford to experiment or make mistakes. Therefore, we rely on technical expertise as well as advice, and Pablo and the OHCHR officers have been excellent partners to us in our journey.We have a long way to go and I am sure we have a lot to learn from best practices elsewhere. This is probably true for a lot of you here as well. Reconciliation is not a box that can be ticked or a journey that can end as per a timeline. There are no magic portions to achieve what we set out to achieve. It requires hard work and constant striving, and a commitment towards which our nation should be bound across generations. National building and healing are not tasks that have an end. This, we understand; and we want to ensure that after so many years of conflict, our nation does not plunge into conflict once again. So with this aim in mind, we set out on pursuing transitional justice to build a nation which respects and upholds the rights of each and every individual citizen of our country.I wish your deliberations all success, and I hope that while you are here, you would also find the time to enjoy Colombo and Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/268-deputy-minister-at-regional-consultations-on-transitional-justice-in-asia-pacific", "title": "Deputy Minister at Regional Consultations on Transitional Justice in Asia-Pacific"},

The government is committed to creating an enabling environment for the media sector which is based on respect for internationally recognised professional standards and practices, and which ensures media accountability to those who rely on the media as a credible source of news and information.The government has examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report Rebuilding Public Trust: An Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka, which was presented to the Hon. Prime Minister on 3 May, World Press Freedom Day, 2016 by the multi-stakeholder partnership for media reforms. The report contained a set of evidence-based recommendations developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and based on UNESCOs widely accepted Media Development Indicators.Similarly, the recently concluded International Conference on RTI Sri Lanka and Media Reforms also deliberated several challenges of the media sector while making some cardinal recommendations.Some of the key recommendations of the report as well as the international conference require the adoption of enabling legislation. Based on this, the government wishes to undertake a consultation with all interested stakeholders on the measures needed to provide adequate legal protection for journalists and to strengthen systems for media self-regulation.The government is ready to ensure legal protection for freedom of the press, including by protecting the medias right to gather news and information, by repealing the SriLankaPress CouncilAct, No 5 of 1979, and by introducing an independent oversight mechanism to foster professional standards, with mandatory powers over media outlets.In this regard, the government invites the views of interested stakeholders in relation to its proposals to introduce legislation:1. To recognise media freedom and the right of the media: (a) to gather and disseminate news and information; (b) to engage in critical reporting on matters of public interest; and (c) to participate in the process of forming public opinion.2. To make it a penal offence for anyone wilfully to obstruct the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist working for a media outlet.3. To put in place systems to promote the safety of journalists.4. To protect journalists right to not to disclose their confidential sources of information.5.

To establish an independent Council with a mandate to develop and apply codes of practice for media outlets, based on internationally recognised standards for the media.The proposed Council will function as the oversight mechanism of a system of self-regulation and will the power to apply sanction for wilful violations of its codes of practice. The approaches towards ensuring the independence of the Right to Information Commission will also be applicable to the Council, which will comprise eminent persons of whom two-thirds are nominated by organisations representing the media and journalists and one-third are nominated by civil society organisations. To ensure the credibility of and the public confidence in the Council, a Judge of a court of law nominated by the Judicial Services Commission in consultation with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka will serve as Chairperson. The tenure of Council members will be protected and, in particular, removal will only be possible by vote of Parliament following a recommendation of the Constitutional Council.The functions and powers of the Council will include the following:a. Adopt professional Codes of Practice,followingapublic consultation involving journalists and editors associations, media unions and civil society.b.

{"date": "October 19, 2016", "text": "As announced to the public on 10.10.2016, the Monetary Board at its meeting held on 14.10.2016 considered resolution issues pertaining to a number of non-bank financial institutions in the context of relevant legal provisions in the interest of protecting the public trust in the financial system.Accordingly, the Monetary Board approved a resolution mechanism for repayment of depositors of three finance companies and legitimate investors in government securities-linked investments in Entrust Securities PLC. The three finance companies are The Standard Credit Finance Ltd., City Finance Corporation Ltd. and Central Investments and Finance PLC. All three companies got into a chronic financial position in 2008 and 2009 due to fraud and mismanagement of funds and, therefore, these companies did not have assets to pay off deposits. All restructuring efforts made by the Central Bank, from time to time, could not produce envisaged results as those who managed these companies failed to arrange an infusion of new capital. As a result, these companies became insolvent and were out of business since then. The Entrust Securities PLC, a company with a primary dealer license to trade government securities, got into a chronic liquidity and insolvency crisis during latter part of 2015 as a result of fraudulent use of funds placed by customers for investment in government securities. The Central Bank on January 4, 2016 suspended the Board of Directors of the Entrust and vested its operations in the National Saving Bank to protect the investors. The Monetary Board reviewed the lack of progress so far and took cognizance of the fact that there was no further room to revive these companies to enable them to repay depositors and investors in the foreseeable future. Given the long-delay involved so far, the Monetary Board approved the company resolution plans submitted by the Department of Supervision of Non-banking Financial Institutions to repay deposits and investments annually commencing from 2017 over a reasonable period of time with a fair interest rate during this repayment period. In the case of the three finance companies, repayment will cover Rs. 4,868 mn of nearly 11,878 depositors. In the case of the Entrust, investments secured with government securities amounting to Rs. 3,100 mn belonging to 107 investors will be settled in the coming weeks. In respect of unsecured investments in the Entrust amounting to Rs. 8,508 mn belonging to 24 individuals and entities, government securities will be allocated and be repaid under the repayment plan to be implemented with the managing support of the Seylan Bank PLC. The Central Bank will complete the required administrative procedures and communicate details to all those depositors and investors. Once the repayment plan is legally finalized, those companies will be dealt with through applicable laws for liquidation. The Monetary Board is of the view that this is the only option that now remains as there are no assets in these companies and no investors have been willing to revive these companies and repay above depositors and investors. As part of the resolution plans, the Central Bank will set up a new Enforcement Division in the Department of Supervision of Non-bank Financial Institutions to institute legal action against Directors and managers who have been responsible for the fraud and misappropriation of funds and to make every effort to recover such funds from them. In the case of the Entrust, the law enforcement authorities, in association with the Central Bank, have already initiated legal actions. The Enforcement Division will also introduce a routine procedure to take legal action against parties who have committed similar fraudulent practices in existing companies, in the event such instances are detected by the examination staff. Further, action will be taken to address lapses in the Central Bank and to strengthen regulatory and supervisory mechanisms on a priority basis to ensure the safety and soundness of existing institutions. However, it is important to stress that the regulation and supervision do not mean a guarantee for each and every deposit and investment made by the public in banks and financial institutions. Those who make such deposits and investments and those who undertake businesses based on these funds are primarily responsible for their business decisions regarding prudent management of their funds. In fact, almost all funds placed in the above distressed companies have been mobilized through unauthorized financial products. Even large depositors and investors have been negligent in not undertaking the normal due diligence on risks and return, despite being sufficiently knowledgeable and skillful to do so. The responsibility of the Central Bank is only to provide an external safeguard through regulation and supervision to the extent permitted in law while facilitating institutions to carry on their businesses essential for the economy and general public in a safe and sound manner in a stable financial system. Therefore, all those who are stakeholders to these resolution plans are kindly requested to co-operate with the Central Bank in order to end this long-standing issue in the public interest. In the event of non-cooperation, the Central Bank will have no option but to reluctantly permit these companies to be wound up under the law.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/219-central-bank-resolves-four-insolvent-financial-institutions-to-protect-depositors-and-promote-the-financial-system-stability", "title": "Central Bank resolves four insolvent financial institutions to protect depositors and promote the financial system stability"},

For this reason the Government of Sri Lanka has identified the attraction of FDI as one of its Key policies in bringing about the rapid development of the country.One vital element in the process for attracting investment is to create strong economic bonds between all countries by entering into investment agreements at the Intra regional level. This can be achieved by developing the necessary capabilities for negotiators to initiate discussions at the bilateral, regional and multilateral level.As far as Sri Lanka is concerned this forum will prove to be very useful as the country is engaged in the process of negotiating FTAs with several key partners in the Asian region such as China and Singapore.The Forum is very much an international event with over 50 countries represented and therefore an excellent platform where delegates with a vast knowledge and experience can share ideas and know how in many areas relating to investment negotiations.The Minister therefore concluded that the forum offers considerable potential for capacity building, networking and the exchange of ideas and experiences.Finally, Minister Samarawickrama elaborated on some of the many improvements that have taken place in Sri Lanka which international participants will be able to witness during their visit to the country. These include the rapid development taking place in the City of Colombo and the large scale development projects.He added that while developing Sri Lanka continues to be an island paradise with a rich cultural heritage and many natural beauties.Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade welcomed the participants of the 10th Annual Forum of Development Countries investments Negotiations which was organized by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), the South Center and co-hosted by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI).

It is clear that the innocent war heroes did not know who led them and this situation can be assumed as an attempt by a group who are against the Government as this protest held in an environment where all the necessary arrangements had already been made to solve the issue.As the minister in charge of Defence, the President had presented a special Cabinet paper to the Cabinet four months ago, to provide these demands of the war heroes. Subsequently, the decision of the Treasury was obtained by the Ministry of Defence.Even though the direct intervention of the President was given on this issue, the protest held with the involvement of a group of Bhikkhus who engaged with political organizations against the Government as well as with the support of few outsiders, is undoubtedly a protest led with some persons with a political agenda. This tense situation arose when a discussion being held at the Defence Ministry between the Secretary for the Ministry of Defence, representatives of the Presidential Secretariat and the representatives of the organization to protect the rights of the war heroes.Even though providing pension benefits to the differently-abled War Heroes who volunteered to retire before completing their 12 year mandatory service period with retirement compensation, is contrary to the provisions of the Armed Forces Pensions and Gratuities Regulations, a decision was taken to provide pension benefits to these war heroes amending those rules and regulations under the direction of the President.When the demonstrators carried out their protest in front of the Presidential Secretariat, a discussion being held at the Presidential Secretariat with a foreign delegation and the Security Forces took steps to control the trespass of demonstrators to prevent them from entering the premises of the Presidents Office.A group of conspirators wanted to put the Government in difficult situation, putting forward the demands of the retired war heroes and although during the past few days they made attempts in this regard, it is apparent that the Security Forces and the Police have fulfilled their duties understanding the scenario.The Ministry of Defence issued a press release on November 06, 2016 promising to pay pension benefits in addition to the monthly salary and allowances and disability allowance from next February.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/255-it-is-a-conspiracy-to-cause-inconvenience-to-government", "title": "It is a conspiracy to cause inconvenience to government"},

He said that the politicians attempting to become so-called patriots and heroes have never attempted to find solutions to genuine issues of the people. He pointed out that these politicians who create problems in the country aiming at votes are committing a national crime that would affect the future generation.President Sirisena said at a time when the government was attempting to bring about a new constitution to solve issues in the country, he was willing to invite politicians, scholars and the intelligent people of the country to join hands to make the endeavour a success.If we cannot strengthen reconciliation among all communities it is a massive disaster, President Sirisena said. The root cause of many of the wars, conflicts and bloodshed in world history has been mostly language, religious, racial and cast differences.He said the issue in Sri Lanka has not been something new, but dates back to ages. Every politician who came to power after independence used this issue to come into power. The conflict worsened and the development in the North stagnated, the President said. However we can see how the North and East was treated by the number of ministerial portfolios given to politicians hailing from those areas.The President said Black July aggravated the conflict and the conflict claimed peoples lives and even resulted in the attack on the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy.Once President J.R. Jayewardene attempted to solve the issue through the Indo- Lanka agreement but failed, President Sirisena said. Even today around 100,000 people are living in camps in India as a result of this issue. Even I have been leveled threats at several occasions because of this issue. Nobody has been able to suppress the opinion of dividing the country by the gun. The then government did not attempt to bring about a lasting peace exploiting the victory achieved by the tri forces.He added that the lasting peace could be established in Sri Lanka on the day when the concept of Eelam was given up locally and internationally.We are attempting to introduce a new constitution, said President Sirisena. Discussions are made in that direction and some are trying to point out that the government is attempting to divide the country. They spread baseless rumours among the Sinhalese and the Buddhists. If we could not solve the issue, those spreading false rumours should take the responsibility for the unfortunate incidents that could happen in the future.He said the new constitution would include a solution that all Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims would accept.President Sirisena said he was ashamed of what the former President said on the constitution that it is to be formulated.He said it was the former President who proposed to even grant more powers than the 13th amendment to the constitution.He said there should be a fair devolution of power. The best representative from the North in solving this issue is with us, he is R. Sampanthan, said the President.Finding solutions should not be delayed. When we attempt to solve the issues of the people who lost their houses and land, some say we are dividing the country, he said.We need a mechanism that would bring about lasting peace and reconciliation among the communities. We are not solving the issues by the gun as ours is a harmless government. Everyone should join hands with us to find a solution.The President said patriotism, humanism, creating a healthy society, freedom, democracy, must contribute to a just society. President Sirisena said seeking power instead of solving issues will not help towards addressing the issue at hand.Maithripala Sirisena added if a country does not have national unity, then that too is considered a national disaster. The President added the Ministry of Disaster Management mainly addresses concerns that arise as a result of natural disasters.However the President added a country that has no national peace, unity and reconciliation, especially if unity among ethnicities does not exist, then that is also considered a national disaster.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/333-need-of-the-hour-is-leaders-who-can-find-just-solutions-president", "title": "Need of the hour is leaders who can find just solutions  President"},

Accordingly the government will have to re-structure loss-making businesses and enterprises through agreements with local and foreign entrepreneurs. Otherwise people will have to incur debt payments for certain State institutions that have huge losses. Our country has fruitful experience ofre-structuring such institutions in the past. It is in this background that the Government has taken steps to convert the Hambantota Port into a joint venture with a private company belonging to the Chinese government. It is a joint concern entered into with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.Already over Rs.150,000 million has been taken as a loan from China to build the Hambantota Port. Though a colossal amount has to be paid as debt instalments and interest the port does not make any profit.Sri Lanka Ports Authority has earned an income of Rs.32, 202 million from January to October 31, 2015. Of it 91.15 % has been earned from the Colombo Port. However, this income had to be allocated for the maintenance of the Hambantota Port and to pay its debts. The maintenance expenses of the Hambantota Port during that period amounted to Rs.2597 million. In addition Rs.8482 had been paid as debt instalments and interest. However, the total income from the Hambantota Port during the relevant period was only Rs.1730 million. Thus every citizen of the country has a debt burden of Rs.10, 000 for the Hambantota Port alone. The only strategy to salvage the Hambantota Port is to make it an income generating enterprise. The government has undertaken a correct economic strategy to fulfill that responsible task. Accordingly the objective of the government is to make the Hambantota Port an income generating enterprise retaining its ownership and leasing it on a 99-year lease agreement. Another objective is to convert it from the present position of a White Elephant to a prime commercial center of the economy. The target of the present government is to make this port a center of active economic operations by converting it as a hub connecting the East and the West and as an entry point into the Sri Lankan economy.It is a genuine task aimed at sustainable economic development of the country. It is not an attempt to sell the Hambantota Port to a foreign country or a betrayal of the country, as some allege.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/364-statement-of-development-strategy-and-international-trade-minister-malik-samarawickrema-on-the-contract-between-the-hambantota-port-and-a-chinese-state-owned-company", "title": "Statement of Development Strategy and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema on the contract between the Hambantota Port and a Chinese State-owned Company"},

The government is committed to creating an enabling environment for the media sector which is based on respect for internationally recognised professional standards and practices, and which ensures media accountability to those who rely on the media as a credible source of news and information.The government has examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report Rebuilding Public Trust: An Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka, which was presented to the Hon. Prime Minister on 3 May, World Press Freedom Day, 2016 by the multi-stakeholder partnership for media reforms. The report contained a set of evidence-based recommendations developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and based on UNESCOs widely accepted Media Development Indicators.Similarly, the recently concluded International Conference on RTI Sri Lanka and Media Reforms also deliberated several challenges of the media sector while making some cardinal recommendations.Some of the key recommendations of the report as well as the international conference require the adoption of enabling legislation. Based on this, the government wishes to undertake a consultation with all interested stakeholders on the measures needed to provide adequate legal protection for journalists and to strengthen systems for media self-regulation.The government is ready to ensure legal protection for freedom of the press, including by protecting the medias right to gather news and information, by repealing the SriLankaPress CouncilAct, No 5 of 1979, and by introducing an independent oversight mechanism to foster professional standards, with mandatory powers over media outlets.In this regard, the government invites the views of interested stakeholders in relation to its proposals to introduce legislation:1. To recognise media freedom and the right of the media: (a) to gather and disseminate news and information; (b) to engage in critical reporting on matters of public interest; and (c) to participate in the process of forming public opinion.2. To make it a penal offence for anyone wilfully to obstruct the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist working for a media outlet.3. To put in place systems to promote the safety of journalists.4. To protect journalists right to not to disclose their confidential sources of information.5. To make it a penal offence to subject anyone to anylegaloremploymentrelatedsanctionorotherformof discriminationforproviding informationto journalistsworking foramediaoutletconcerning publicaffairsoronmattersofpublicinterest,exceptwherethe secrecyof theinformation is justified byalarger publicinterest.6. To make it illegal to impose sanctions on or to terminate the employment of an editor or a journalist because of his or her refusal to violate recognised professional codes of practice.7. To establish an independent Council with a mandate to develop and apply codes of practice for media outlets, based on internationally recognised standards for the media.The proposed Council will function as the oversight mechanism of a system of self-regulation and will the power to apply sanction for wilful violations of its codes of practice. The approaches towards ensuring the independence of the Right to Information Commission will also be applicable to the Council, which will comprise eminent persons of whom two-thirds are nominated by organisations representing the media and journalists and one-third are nominated by civil society organisations.To ensure the credibility of and the public confidence in the Council, a Judge of a court of law nominated by the Judicial Services Commission in consultation with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka will serve as Chairperson. The tenure of Council members will be protected and, in particular, removal will only be possible by vote of Parliament following a recommendation of the Constitutional Council.The functions and powers of the Council will include the following:a.

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "A free, independent and diverse media with high ethical standards and professional competence, dedicated to provide a wide range of information and ideas to citizens, while serving as a public forum for well-informed democratic dialogue, is indispensable for the building and maintaining of democracy in Sri Lanka. The government is committed to creating an enabling environment for the media sector which is based on respect for internationally recognised professional standards and practices, and which ensures media accountability to those who rely on the media as a credible source of news and information.The government has examined the comprehensive assessment of the overall environment for media development as set out in the report Rebuilding Public Trust: An Assessment of the Media Industry and Profession in Sri Lanka, which was presented to the Hon. Prime Minister on 3 May, World Press Freedom Day, 2016 by the multi-stakeholder partnership for media reforms. The report contained a set of evidence-based recommendations developed through a multi-stakeholder consultative process and based on UNESCOs widely accepted Media Development Indicators.Similarly, the recently concluded International Conference on RTI Sri Lanka and Media Reforms also deliberated several challenges of the media sector while making some cardinal recommendations.Some of the key recommendations of the report as well as the international conference require the adoption of enabling legislation. Based on this, the government wishes to undertake a consultation with all interested stakeholders on the measures needed to provide adequate legal protection for journalists and to strengthen systems for media self-regulation.The government is ready to ensure legal protection for freedom of the press, including by protecting the medias right to gather news and information, by repealing the SriLankaPress CouncilAct, No 5 of 1979, and by introducing an independent oversight mechanism to foster professional standards, with mandatory powers over media outlets.In this regard, the government invites the views of interested stakeholders in relation to its proposals to introduce legislation:1. To recognise media freedom and the right of the media: (a) to gather and disseminate news and information; (b) to engage in critical reporting on matters of public interest; and (c) to participate in the process of forming public opinion.2. To make it a penal offence for anyone wilfully to obstruct the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist working for a media outlet.3. To put in place systems to promote the safety of journalists.4. To protect journalists right to not to disclose their confidential sources of information.5. To make it a penal offence to subject anyone to anylegaloremploymentrelatedsanctionorotherformof discriminationforproviding informationto journalistsworking foramediaoutletconcerning publicaffairsoronmattersofpublicinterest,exceptwherethe secrecyof theinformation is justified byalarger publicinterest.6. To make it illegal to impose sanctions on or to terminate the employment of an editor or a journalist because of his or her refusal to violate recognised professional codes of practice.7. To establish an independent Council with a mandate to develop and apply codes of practice for media outlets, based on internationally recognised standards for the media.The proposed Council will function as the oversight mechanism of a system of self-regulation and will the power to apply sanction for wilful violations of its codes of practice. The approaches towards ensuring the independence of the Right to Information Commission will also be applicable to the Council, which will comprise eminent persons of whom two-thirds are nominated by organisations representing the media and journalists and one-third are nominated by civil society organisations. To ensure the credibility of and the public confidence in the Council, a Judge of a court of law nominated by the Judicial Services Commission in consultation with the Bar Association of Sri Lanka will serve as Chairperson. The tenure of Council members will be protected and, in particular, removal will only be possible by vote of Parliament following a recommendation of the Constitutional Council.The functions and powers of the Council will include the following:a. Adopt professional Codes of Practice,followingapublic consultation involving journalists and editors associations, media unions and civil society.b. Monitor theperformanceofmedia outletstoensureduecompliancewith the Codes of Practice.c. Hold inquiries into alleged violations of theCodes of Practicebased on complaints or the monitoring ofthe Council,and issuedecisions.d.

Co-operate with or undertaketrainingandeducational activities, including by producing trainingmaterials on the effective implementation oftheCodes of Practice.g. Exercise powers which are similar to those wielded by the Right to Information Commission in terms of conducting inquiries, with provisions for appeals to the courts against the Council's decisions.h. In terms of sanctions, the Council will have the power to issue warnings to media outlets and to order amedia outlet to publish or broadcast the Councils decision in the manner prescribed bytheCouncil.i. Mediate between employersand employees ofmedia outlets in relation to disputes concerningtheenforcement of theCodesof Practice.The proposed legislation will be applicable to all print and broadcast media outlets, as well as to online media outlets which formally agree to comply with the Codes of Practice.It shall be an offence for any media outlet to refuse to comply with or to give effect to a decision of the Council, which may be punished by the imposition of a fine after a summary trial before a court of law. Similarly, obstructing the legitimate collection of news and information by a journalist, forcing a journalist to disclose a confidential source of information or discriminating against a journalist who refuses to violate the Codes of Practice will be offenses.The government invites media organisations, owners and publishers associations, journalists unions and associations, civil society organisations and members of the public to express their views on this proposal.

{"date": "October 06, 2016", "text": "The national carrier SriLankan Airlines focus on re-structuring its operations to effect a turnaround is recording a significant reduction in losses, coupled with a rationalization of routes and aircraft.Stringent cost controls underscored by heightened accountability and transparency have been cornerstones of the new strategy. The new management, supported by the incumbent government, is successfully shedding its past legacy as a loss-making institution by adopting a leaner approach and making strategic moves to strengthen its position as a leading regional airline.In the Financial Year ending 31st March 2016, the airline recorded a significantly improved performance compared to the previous year. Despite many challenges still remaining, it is encouraging to note that the airlines performance in the first five months of the current financial year has seen a similar trend of improved performance. At the end of the last financial year, without the one-off payment relating to cancellation of the lease of one A350 aircraft, the airlines Group Loss stood at LKR 9.03 billion, which represents a 45% improvement for the 2015/16 financial year compared to the previous year. The net loss after taking the one-off item into consideration is LKR 11.59 billion, compared to the net loss of LKR 16.33 billion during the previous year. The performance for the first five months of the current financial year witnessed a 37% improvement, with a lower Group Loss of LKR 2.32 billion compared to the previous years Group Loss of LKR 3.71 billion. The interest cost alone for this period was LKR 2.53 billion.Whilst the steep drop in fuel prices contributed to the improved performance of the previous year and the first five months of the current financial year, this benefit was significantly eroded with the airlines declining revenue. This is due to the addition of capacity to the Colombo market by other airlines, accompanied by a dramatic drop in airfares in certain markets. The performance was further impacted by the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee. In fact, it has been impacted by a loss of LKR 1.03 billion just for the five months of this financial year alone. It is also a significant fact that the airline carries a huge finance cost, which again contributes to the increase in the Groups Loss. The total interest bearing liabilities as at 31st August 2016 to banks/ financial institutions is USD 478.5 million (LKR 69.7 billion). The interest cost for the current financial year is estimated at LKR 6.2 billion. As part of the restructuring of the airline, the GOSL is expected to restructure the balance sheet by taking off this debt, which substantially will improve the financial position of the Company. Re-structuring an airline is no easy task. Re-structuring a legacy airline towards making it a sustainable entity is even more challenging. Therefore, given the complexity of the business, the re-structuring is being approached in a responsible manner in consultation with the shareholders.In a bold and informed step, the airline, in conjunction with the relevant government authorities, reversed the A350 aircraft deal which was signed in 2013. After careful consideration of a multitude of factors, including current and foreseeable future market conditions, the onset of fierce competition, the inherited adverse financial situation of the company, and the very high lease rentals of the A350 aircraft, it became clear that these aircraft could not be operated economically. Although significant one-off costs had to be agreed to in order to terminate the contracts, it was recognized that inducting and operating these aircraft would not augur well for a sustainable bottom line going forward. The Fleet strategy for the future will complement the network strategy of more medium and short haul destinations using narrow-body aircraft and wide-body aircraft with lower ownership costs. The network rationalization has seen some unprecedented decisions having been made on the routes. By the first week of November, routes to Continental Europe will no longer be operated by the airline. SriLankans gateway to Europe will be London, with Continental Europe being served by a number of code shares with partners, offering passengers a seamless product. This decision too was the result of a careful study of the network. While the strategy of network rationalization is not uncommon in most airlines restructuring, SriLankan further recognized that rationalization alone will not bring about sustainability. Hence, it has identified certain new markets which it can serve profitably, as well as existing destinations that can be served with increased frequencies.Gan, in the Maldives, will be the first such new destination, and SriLankan will be the only international airline serving Gan. Other potential destinations in India and South East Asia are being evaluated and will be introduced as the narrow-body fleet deliveries come on stream from the next financial year.The integration of the Mihin Lanka routes with SriLankan has helped to consolidate the schedule enabling more productive and efficient inventory management which is forecast to improve the revenues. With this integration, additional frequencies operated will be operated to the Seychelles and Dhaka will receive wide-body flights.No restructuring effort can be successful towards bring about sustainability, without a clear focus on costs while at the same time not compromising on safety and security. Notwithstanding numerous challenges, the airline has been able to contain its costs and make savings in certain controllable items. This has been due to increased scrutiny of expenses across all areas. The airlines staff have come forward to make constructive suggestions towards cost-saving initiatives and also worked hard at negotiating cost reductions with vendors. Aircraft Lease costs, being the second-largest cost item for the airline next to fuel, had to be addressed. The Wet Lease of an A330-300 aircraft to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is an initiative towards this end. It is expected that the airline will negotiate a longer term dry lease with PIA for three A330-300 aircraft at the end of the wet lease period.The revenues from this project will offset the high lease rentals on these aircraft.Commenting on the ongoing restructuring activities and performance of the airline, Capt. Suren Ratwatte, CEO of SriLankan Airlines, explains, The new management is committed to building revenues, consolidating operations and controlling costs, which are already helping to strengthen the companys bottom line. As a company, we are consciously sweating our assets harder to ensure optimal utilization of all resources. The strategic decision to position the airline as a regional player has been followed up by rationalization of our fleet to consist of more narrow-body aircraft rather than A350s, which are meant for long haul destinations. We have a clear blueprint mapping our trajectory to become a leaner and more efficient operator, which is being achieved steadily, after years of loss-making operations. More than anything else, we are proud of the culture of transparency and accountability that has been instilled in the organization which in time will restore the reputation enjoyed by the airline in the first few decades of its establishment.The Airlines Aviation College is steadily becoming a magnet for students from Sri Lanka and the region wanting to build a successful career in the aviation industry. It is the only European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certified aviation college in the region offering engineering, ground handling and cabin crew training in-house. The airlines EASA certified MRO capability is held in high esteem with the airline being awarded contracts by several airlines for third party work, which is expected to grow in the future and be a significant source of revenue for the airline.While a great deal of attention has been paid to the re-structuring efforts, the management has kept a close watch on service and standards which are the cornerstone of this industry. The airline has continued to invest in people and training to maintain service standards to complement its product, which is on par with the best-in-class. When asked to comment on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) for the airline, Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, Ajith Dias, stated The negotiation is being initiated by the Government of Sri Lanka, which is negotiating with several prospective partners who have communicated their expressions of interest. The lead manager for this transaction is the National Savings Bank. Our objective is to focus on re-structuring the airline in order to ensure a framework for sustainability is in place for a PPP that the shareholder will enter into.", "url": "https://www.dgi.gov.lk/news/latest-news/188-srilankan-airlines-chartering-a-course-towards-a-sustainable-future", "title": "SriLankan Airlines chartering a course towards a sustainable future"},

However the transition to the type G standard plug and socket should not require any premises to be re-wired purely for the purpose of accommodating the new standard, and that the existing wiring may remain until the end of its useful life. Also from 16th August 2016, wiring of new installations, addition of circuits to existing installations or complete re-wiring of existing installation, should be wired with 2.5 mm2 (7/0.67 mm Cu) to be compatible for the requirements of type G 13 A socket outlets.Sri Lanka currently use different types of plugs and sockets to make a connection to a wall socket, to which the plug on an appliance does not often fit, electricity users adopt a variety of methods and devices, most of which are unsafe and cause the connection to be unreliable. Sri Lanka reported about 95 electrocutions in 2015 up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. Use of various substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors, and extension cords are one of the main causes for electrocution and fire.The Standard received the Cabinet approval which proposed by Hon. Prime Minister RanilWickremesinghe in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to apply G grade as the sole standard for plugs and socket used in Sri Lanka, and to allow the use of plugs and socket outlets which are sold within next two years, to the end of their lifetime.The Standard was finalized through a wider public consultation where general public, industrialist, manufacturers, energy sector experts and other stakeholders involved in the decision making process. This standard is effective from 16th August 2016, the Commission said. Time FrameThe Commission has issued the following time table for the standardisation of a single plug and socket outlet in Sri Lanka: National Standard for plugs and socket outlet is effective from 16th August 2016 Manufacturing and importing of nonstandard plugs and socket outlets will be banned from 16th August 2017. The sale of such appliances will be banned from August 16, 2018, with any remaining stocks to be sold after being replaced with a square pin plug.
