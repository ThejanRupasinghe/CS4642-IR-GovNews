The government will definitely work to change the life style of the people living in Colombo in the future. The education model practiced in Sri Lanka is from Germany and is known as the factory model where children are educated to face competitive exams and the best get the jobs. This model leads to many sicknesses and pressures among the children. The model introduced by Finland does not have exams and competition. They are not trained on a particular skill but guided to solve the problems faced by society. In addition due to the development of technology new technology based systems have also been introduced where as in our country we are still practicing the factory model.Colombo City will become one of the best economic centers in the world while the Port will change our lives after 2019.
