The High Commissioner further elaborated that maple syrup is a quintessential part of Canadian history, heritage and culture. While we may not be able to bring a Canadian sugar bush, snow-made maple toffees, or a Cabane  sucre here, we can share a small taste of what makes Canada so wonderful with our friends in Sri Lanka. Come and enjoy!Canadas food and agriculture products are diverse as its land and people and Canadian quality never fails. The High Commission is honoured to partner with the Sri Lanka Canada Business Council and the Kingsbury Hotel for this event to showcase one of the finest products that Canada has to offer.Quality is in our nature is the branding slogan for Canadas globally accepted best-quality food products and highlights the ability to meet the upwardly mobile lifestyles of the Sri Lankans who seek the best when it comes to traditional or fusion cuisine. Maple syrup, a distant cousin of jaggery, fits well with the Sri Lankan palate and adapts well to many Sri Lankan dishes and recipes. It can be used in a variety of dishes, both savoury and sweet, and even for cosmetics!

Its culinary applications are nearly endless and health benefits are without question.
