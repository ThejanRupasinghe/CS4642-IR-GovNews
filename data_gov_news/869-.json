This academy is for a political movement which will act with knowledge, wisdom and understanding, he said.The main challenge against building of a pure political movement is that the politicians dont have enough experience. All young politicians of the SLFP should know about the way of the party which had many ups and downs, the President said.He pointed out that any corrupter can wear white clothes and win elections due to the preferential vote system. The breakdowns of the political parties and the worshipping for personalities in this political system can be changed only through the knowledge and understanding, he said.The SLFP was born by fulfilling the requirement of a patriotic force which admires the nationalism, our own values and Sri Lankan culture.
