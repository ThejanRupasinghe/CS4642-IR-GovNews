ONUR and the EU Delegation invite Amateur and Professional photographers to submit their interpretations of the theme of reconciliation. Out of those submitted, 70 best entries, as evaluated by an expert panel of judges will be featured in a public exhibition in September 2017. Selected photos will also be published in the EU Delegation calendar for 2018 and a booklet produced by ONUR. The organisers encourage submissions from Amateur photographers including photos taken through Smartphones. Winners of both Amateur and Professional categories will be given valuable prizes.Commenting on the initiative, Chairperson of Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said: At ONUR are working on various fronts with students, academics, universities, policy makers, civil society and the clergy in taking the message of national unity and reconciliation forward. This is in line with the priorities of the present government and we are hoping the photography exhibition will allow general public to engage further with us by creatively expressing what reconciliation really means to them.\"Supporting reconciliation in Sri Lanka is a key priority for the European Union,\" said Paul Godfrey, Counsellor at the EU Delegation. \"We have partnered with the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation in this initiative to encourage Sri Lankans to reflect on their hopes for the future of the country. We want this exhibition to generate discussion about empathising with fellow Sri Lankans on the need for national reconciliation. Through reconciliation, we believe there is the hope of more inclusive identities that value the diversity of people and cultures in the island\".How to Submit:Image resolution: In the highest possible resolution and native formatFile Size for Submission: Not exceeding 25MBInformation: Name of Photographer, Location of the Photograph and Preferred Title of the EntryEmail entries to: This email address is being protected from spambots.
