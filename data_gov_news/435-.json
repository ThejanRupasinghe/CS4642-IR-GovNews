He was addressing the opening ceremony of the Rs.1.3 million worth new RO Plant established by the Sri Lanka Navy at the Katugahahena Divisional Hospital in Mathugama.He said those statements are only dreams and the government will go ahead. The President and the Prime Minister are working with a vision. Although in the minds of some politicians the hatred remains, the matured ministers are always working to protect the government.Former leaders of our country strengthened their political power with the constitutional amendments, but the present president is reducing his power. He will take steps to abolish the executive presidency with the new constitution. We will end the era where the young criticized the politicians.Further speaking about a transfer of the District Medical Officer in the Katugahahena hospital Dr. Ranjith Dissanayake to the Bulathsinhala hospital, the minister said he has informed the Director General of Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala to cancel the transfer and added that he opposed to the political interference in transfers of health officials.Deputy minister Palitha Thewarapperuma, and the Commander of Sri Lanka Navy Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunarathne also participated.",
