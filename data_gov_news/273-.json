In addition she pointed out that the telephone number 1929 for prevention of child abuses has been further empowered and the Police Division attached to the Child Protection Authority takes swift actions regarding the received complaints with the assistance of the Police Station in the area where the child abuse took place.In case of non-criminal matters, they will be directed to relevant sections such as Divisional Secretariat, Labour Offices, or Ministry of Education. In the past discussions on child abuse was focused on solutions to such abuses, but today it has changed and more attention is paid on prevention of child abuses.She added that steps have been taken to conduct awareness programmes in school level, and for parents and communities through community programmes.",
