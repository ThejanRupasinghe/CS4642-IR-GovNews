  "text": "The issue on transporting soil by brick manufacturers in Pathadumbara and Harispattuwa Divisional Secretary's Divisions was solved by the Kandy Coordinating Committee meeting held the other day.The Committee decided to provide a relief to people who make bricks as a domestic industry by lightening laws on soil transportation considering the facts presented by Padmalal de Alwis a member of the Central Provincial Council.Domestic brick manufacturers recently held a protest campaign blocking the A-9 road on 22nd November, claiming that imposing the licence fee imposed to large scale smugglers of soil on them is unjust.They are engaged in this industry by tradition. Recently the police has informed them to obtain the licence required to cut soil or otherwise they will be charged a fine of Rs. 50,000.Focusing on this matter Chairman of the Committee Minister S.B. Dissanayake said that they could be granted a relief if the committee members agree.As no one objected the transportation of less than 35 cubes was allowed on the recommendation of the Divisional Secretary. The accurate details on domestic bricks makers are in the Divisional Secretariat and they were directed by Minister S.B. Dissanayake to provide such information to the police. Such people who engage in this industry in tradition are in Egodawela, Megodawela, Pollegoda, Kalugalwatte, etc. in the Kandy District and they are benefitted by the decision taken by the Committee.",
