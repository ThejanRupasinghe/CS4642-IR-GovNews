Sri Lanka obtained accreditation status in the African Union (AU) in April 2014 as a non-African State and accordingly, the newly appointed Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Addis Ababa will represent the Government of Sri Lanka at the African Union as an Observer in his capacity as the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the African Union.",
