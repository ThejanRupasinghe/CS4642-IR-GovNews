Though the disabled war heroes have already taken the compensation entitled by them, the President decided to grant them this service pension, though the government has to take a large burden in this regard.Although, these officers retired voluntarily before 2008 and there were no protests for the past 8 years regarding these demands.Though it is contradictory to grant this service pension to the disabled war heroes who had been in the service for 12 years, the President decided to provide this service pension to them by amending the laws and regulations.The pension for the war heroes who became disabled had not been paid after they reached 55 years of age. But the President will take action to grant them that pension and their salary throughout their lives.",
