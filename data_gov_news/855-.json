As an initial step, I wish to visit Sri Lanka with the leaders of tourism industry of Bahia and we would indeed be happy to receive such delegations from Sri Lanka also said the Governor Costa. Ambassador Jayasuriya said that Sri Lanka tourism witnessed a robust growth after the defeat of LTTE terrorist group in 2009. We had over two million tourists in 2016 - but only 1,400 from Brazil. This is due to lack of awareness said Ambassador Jayasuriya.
