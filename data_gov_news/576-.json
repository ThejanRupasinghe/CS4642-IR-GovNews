The project aims to improve onion productivity by using Korean agricultural technologies, and accordingly to help Sri Lankan farmers to be self-sufficient.During the implementation of the project, the Centre established 3 model farm villages for onion production at Mannar, Galenbindunuwewa and Hambantota, including4 onion storages (165m2), each of which comprises 12 shelves at 5 levels. The Centre also donated basic agricultural equipment and 2 ha rain shelters (500m2) to 40 Sri Lanka farmers.Thanks to the Centres efforts, the Sri Lankan farmers benefited from the shared agricultural technologies on onion production transferred by Korean agricultural experts and Sri Lankan researchers of FCRDI. One of the technologies is to transport onion mother-bulbs to Nuwaraeliya for vernalization and then return them to the origin fields. Onions were cultivated in 4 ha field of poly-tunnels in Galenbindunuwewa and Hambantotafor 2016-17, and about 800 kg and 400 kg of the crops will be harvested in the respective areas.",
