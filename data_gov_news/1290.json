In order to achieve these objectives, the government has set out a high-level reform agenda in several key sectors of the economy, facilitating and empowering the private sector as the principle engine of growth.Formulation of a new trade and investment policy, tax reforms, and various other measures to improve investor climate are also being implemented.Given the rapid increase in climate related disasters in many countries, like the floods Sri Lanka faced 02 weeks ago, the building of climate/disaster resilient infrastructure will be of paramount importance for the future. If we are to meet this challenge, we must incorporate climate resilient concepts into all future infrastructure development projects.The Hon. Minister also had the opportunity to meet Hon. Kin Dong-Yeon the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Strategy & Finance of Republic of Korea, Hon. Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister of India and Hon.
