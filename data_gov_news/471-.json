All of us must unite to fulfill respective duties and responsibilities for the existence of all the living creatures including humans as well as the nature.As the first phase of the program for the greenization of the building sector in Sri Lanka from 2017 to maintain the buildings in the government sector as eco-friendly buildings, the green building guide and the green evaluation programmes have been formed by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry and the Urban Development Authority, under the guidance of the Presidential Secretariat.These publications were presented to the President by the Secretary of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment Udaya R.
