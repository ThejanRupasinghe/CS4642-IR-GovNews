According to the Media release issued by the European Commission on 11th January the EC has decided to give the GSP Plus to support the reforms in Sri Lanka and provide a vast access to the EU.GSP Plus is not a relief given by the EC for agreeing to 58 conditions but it is given as an incentive for the continuing effort to establish good governance, human rights and sustainable development in the country.The Media Release issued by the EC has not mentioned any violation of conditions to give this relief but it has been given on the basis of continuous dedication made by Sri Lanka to ensure sustainable development, good governance, and human rights.During the bilateral and multi-lateral discussions, Sri Lankas stand on human rights and good governance was explained and this decision can be considered as an agreement to these stands.",
