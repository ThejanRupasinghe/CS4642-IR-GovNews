Destroying the possible mosquito breeding places and fumigation will be carried out under this program. At this program, which is implemented by the National Dengue Prevention Unit of the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, special attention will be paid to Colombo, Kalutara, Gampaha, Galle Districts, and Kalmunai where an increased number of dengue cases are reported. About 640 groups including Tri forces, Police, and Health workers will be engaged in the program in these areas while other areas are being covered by divisional health officials.In Galle District, the fumigations are being carried out daily due to the increase of the density of larvae within the Galle Municipal area, Ambalangoda, and Balapitiya MOH divisions. Following the instructions of Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne, 20 fumigation machines will be airlifted on Friday. Another 105 machines will be received in January. 48,682 Dengue patients have been reported so far this year and 77 have died.",
