This was revealed at a progress and performance review meeting held in the Ministry on 16th January under the chairmanship of Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Mahinda Amaraweera.   The minister at this event also gave directives to the officials regarding the fisheries development programmes and projects for 2017.According to the statistics of the Ministry, fish exports income in 2016 was reported as Rs.1200 million. Such an achievement was possible due to the high demand in the international market for Sri Lankan Crab, Shrimp, Lobster and live fish. However, we are still catering only to 1/3 of the total requirement.Fish imports income in 2015 was Rs. 20,336 million and in 2016 it has become Rs. 21,539 million generating a profit of Rs. 1203 million. Even though the amount of exported fish has reduced by 2.6%, the income of fish exports has increased due to the high price.With the lifting of EU fish ban fish exports have increased. However, the fish exports to European countries are not included in these statistics.",
