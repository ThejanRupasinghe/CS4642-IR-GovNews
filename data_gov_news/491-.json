The Thai Pongal Day, which is known as the harvest festival of the farmers, is celebrated by the Tamils all over the world with much gratitude to the Sun God who creates seasons through which the farmers are able to do their cultivation and harvest their crops.As the New Year begins with lots of expectations, on this Thai Pongal day my prayer and wish is that we would find a reasonable, lasting political solution to the unresolved national question through the new constitution, which will be a significant milestone in the history of our country.As we have entered into a year filled with immense challenges and expectations, I extend my best wishes to all the people of this country on this day of Thai Pongal for a future filled with joy happiness and prosperity.R. Sampanthan,Leader of the Opposition",
