While being conscious of her role as a wife and a mother, it goes without saying that the woman of today has the capacity and the potential to play a greater role economically, socially and spiritually. As a nation, we must be able to set the stage for her to be accepted, acknowledged and recognized within a wider context; one in which we can truly assure her of an equal position and the rightful place in our society.It is the obligation of the society and the government to ensure that women in Sri Lanka are able to aspire to the kind of empowerment women all over the world have experienced in modern times.My hope is that the theme of this year's International Women's Day will encourage and facilitate the Sri Lankan woman, towards truly fulfilling the role required of her within a greater economic and a social framework at a national level.This International Women's Day may every Sri Lankan woman find the strength within her to successfully overcome challenges and emerge as a confident stake holder of Sri Lanka's common future.Ranil WickremesinghePrime Minister",
