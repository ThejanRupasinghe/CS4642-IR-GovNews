  "text": "Although it has been stated that Hydro Power generation capacity is at 80% at present, this is\nonly sufficient to provide the countrys electricity requirement for 40 days, said Minister Patali\nChampika Ranawaka.\nAddressing a function in Hanwella yesterday the Minister of Power and Energy said that if\nwe are to progress as a country we need to come up with a formula to calculate pricing for\npetroleum and electricity.\nWe are in the process of overcoming two of the greatest challenges faced in the power sector,\nwhich is providing electricity to all uninterrupted. The current annual electricity requirement of\nthe country is 12,000 gw hours. Although the cost per unit for the first 6000 gw. is Rs. 7.00 it\ncosts Rs. 32.00 for production and distribution of the balance 6000 gw, he added.\nThe Minister further added that it was not appropriate to increase electricity tariffs by Rs. 5 in\nrelations to the Rs. 30.00 increase in petroleum prices in the world market.\nRanawaka said that he does not approve of the method of all electricity consumers having to\nbear the burden of power consumption, where only a handful of the large scale industrialists\nconsume a larger position of power. Therefore is suggested that these large scale industrialists\nshould formulate methods of producing their own power for their requirements.\nIn order to fulfill the electricity requirement of the country it is necessary to resort to thermal\npower generation. However the Ceylon Electricity Board bears a major portion of the losses\nincurred without putting the entire burden on the consumer.\nTherefore the minister suggested that a formula similar to the one used when increasing bus\nfairs and gas prices is needed for electricity billing as well.\n",
