  "text": "Power generation through solar power is very useful to country and environment and even to people individually. Making one million of house premises as power producing units through solar power system is the main aim of us. This concept of power generation though solar power is the best and the foremost useful concept. However, people are not thinking much about this. One matter generally attracted would not take much time to get socialized. But, unfortunately useless petty things are quickly getting into socialization. However, making this type of concept into socialization is a very hard struggle. Therefore, steps will be taken to make each and every house enabling to become as power generating unit and as well as to make the people aware through provision of solar power packages to all places of worship and in particular to government institutions. Today, we have provided all Divisional Secretariat Offices in District of Kegalle with solar power packages. From today onwards, the electricity bills of these offices would become zero, not only that but also all houses in Sri Lanka become rapidly as power generating units by bringing the concept of generation of solar power even among the staff working in such offices the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, pointed out.\n",
