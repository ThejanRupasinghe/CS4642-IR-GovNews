The most cost effective power generating source is water, but currently there is a shortage of water in the catchment areas. Therefore it is vital that we turn to renewable energy sources in order to minimise our production costs. We should also device methods of minimising power piracy and also encourage consumers to use electricity sparingly, she added.\nThe minister said that her primary responsibility was to provide an efficient and continues electricity supply to the general public. In order to achieve this goal, the commitment of the CEB employees is vital, she said.
