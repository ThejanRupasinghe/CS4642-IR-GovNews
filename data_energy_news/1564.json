The minister pointed out that with the completion of the KIllinochchi grid substation the current level of 32% electrification will be enhanced to 100%. During his visit the minister held a special discussion with the project officials and emphasised the need to energise the Killinochchi grid substation expeditiously for the development of industries in the area. Hence the project director Anuruddha Tillakaratne said that the Killinochchi grid substation will be energised by next month.\nHe further pointed out that with the energising of the Killinochchi grid substation it will facilitate the uninterrupted power supply to the area and will also serve as a permanent solution to the low voltage problems.\nThe Manager Engineering of the project S.A.D.A. Peiris pointed out that the Killinochchi grid substation which was constructed utilising local engineering skills can be classified as a key grid substation in the country. The project was completed at a cost of Rs. 3085 million, which was obtained through a long term loan facility from the Japanese government.\nMeanwhile minister Ranawaka stated that as the next step of this project a high tension power transmission line from the Killinochchi grid substation to Jaffna will be constructed.
