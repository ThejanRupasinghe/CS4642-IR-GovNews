  "text": "The power conservation campaign Today for tomorrow was launched yesterday jointly by the ministry of power and energy and the ministry of education. The National inaugural ceremony was held at 08.00 am at Ananda college Colombo with the patronage of ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka and Bandula Gunawardena. 1000 students participated in this main ceremony, while 4 million school children from schools around the country took an oath to conserve electricity at 08.15 am today.\nThe ministry of education has issued a circular compelling all schools to implement the commitment, where student would recite the pledge in all three languages during assembly every Monday morning for the next six months.\nAttending the main ceremony at Ananda college minister Ranawaka said that it is the younger generation that has to take on the responsibilities of the future. It is with the aim of creating a better future for the younger generation that we commenced this national energy conservation drive. Power is required for around 80% of the needs of every human. Within the next few years oil, gas and energy sources will exhaust. Currently the oil reserves account for around 1200 billion barrels. Of this amount around 90 million barrels are used up daily. Hence in around the next 30 years the oil reserves will be used up. Therefore it is appropriate to mention that our future generations will face a future without these energy sources. The use of fossil fuels also contributes to environmental pollution, which will destroy 25% of living organisms, including man. Therefore it is imperative that we save energy for a better tomorrow. During the peak hours of 06.30 and 09.30 pm I urge you all to contribute to this national endeavour of energy conservation by curtailing the use of power, he added.\nMeanwhile also addressing the ceremony Education Minister Bandula Gunawardena said many that difficulties arise when trying to meet mans needs with the limited amount of resources available. Therefore we must contribute toward the drive to conserve energy without wasting it unnecessarily. Around 4% of our cost of living is spent on electricity. The time has come for us to focus on low cost energy sources. You as children can also assist in this national energy preservation drive, by simple acts such as switching off a light, refraining from ironing and switching off the refrigerator, during the peak hours of between 06.30 and 09.30 pm. Through these simple deeds you could contribute to saving as much as Rs. 20 billion annually. Acting with responsibility and commitment as children today, will create a better future generation, said the minister of Education.\nThe power conservation campaign Today for tomorrow was launched yesterday jointly by the ministry of power and energy and the ministry of education.
