  "text": "The dedication and commitment of the employees of the CEB have been the key factor in the removal of the tag that was placed on the CEB as an institution squandering state funds. Distancing themselves from the traditional Employer employee rivalry, the employees of the CEB organized a cultural pagent recently under the patronage of the Minister of Power and Energy Patali Champika Ranawaka at the Janakala Kendraya in Battaramulla.\nNot only to develop knowledge among the employees but this Pageant was organized with the intention of providing a platform for the talents of them as well as further developing their abilities. Arts maketh a man complete. Similarly sports encourage a sound mind and leadership qualities. A man complete with Positive Attitudes, Knowledge, and skill will always be appreciated. The CEB stated that while this event was organized with the aim of appreciating the dedication and commitment of the workers a sport festival will also be organized in the near future.\nThe Minister stated that without dedication and commitment nothing can be achieved and said that because of their dedication the employees have managed to turn the CEB which was dogged down by debt for years into a thriving institution. The minister finally urged the employees to make this victory a lasting commitment.\n",
