The reduction of the generation capacity from 300 MWs to 150 MWs was a drawback but it was still a victory for the government to have succeeded in implementing the UKPGP even with a reduced capacity, he said.\nThe power and energy sector had suffered a setback due to political, social and religious pressures from various quarters \nSri Lanka has achieved this progress in power and energy at a time when other countries in the region have power cuts that extended for 18  20 hours a day. There is no country in the region that does not have power\nSri Lankas longest tunnel, the 12.9 km long Upper Kotmale tunnel was declared open by President Mahinda Rajapaksa today\n",
