  "text": "Minister of power and energy Mr.Patali Champika Ranawaka said a new electricity tariff system will be introduced from next October. addressing a ceremony held in the Women Graduates Association Hall in Borella.\nThe main challenge of the Ceylon Electricity Board was to provide electricity to its consumers round the clock. At the moment the target had been successfully achieved. Now there is no more ideas about implementing power cuts.We were able to purchase a unit of electricity at Rs.17 from the Uthuru Janani diesel power plant instead of spending Rs.30 per unit as the previous government did by purchasing electricity from other diesel power stations.\nBy today, the Ceylon Electricity Board had become a financilly independent entity. And it is operating profitably. The previous rule offered Rs.3600 millions per year to continue the operations of diesel power plants. A set of racketeers established due to this huge transactions of money. Therefore the electricity board needed to have an independent trade union which is not driven by the agendas of political parties.\n",
