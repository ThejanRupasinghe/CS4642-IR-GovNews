We want to extend this facility to small and medium scale industrialists as they are a major part of the development process in the country, Minister Ranawaka said.\nChief Guest of the event Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa commended the move by two major state sector institutions  the CEB and the Samurdhi Bank  to implement another people-friendly programme which is likely to make significantly contributions to the countrys progress.\nHe added that the policies adopted by Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka have made power to all by 2012, a reachable target.\n",
