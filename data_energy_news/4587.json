The intention of the subject minister and the ministry is to regard electricity as a legal right for every citizen. Amid existing drought situation and high oil prices government is able to provide electricity without any interruption. With that situation these illegal electricity tappers creates a huge economic loss to the CEB and it is necessary to strengthen the investigation unit. The minister said that he is dedicated to provide assistance to the legal proceedings taken by CEB.\nThe Minister openly urged the law abiding citizens to report such fraudulent activities (meter tampering and using hooks) to the special investigations unit on telephone no. 0112422259.
