  "text": "The Minister of Power and Energy, Patali Champika Ranawaka stated that global warming has turned the incidents of the fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow, into a reality, affecting many areas in the US including New York and New Jersey in United States.\nThe Minister pointed out that the heavy use of energy in developed countries has been identified as the main contributory factor attributed for global warming.\nHe further stated that 80% of the global economy depends on fossil fuel such as oil, coal and gas. However the use of fossil fuels increases that carbon levels released into the atmosphere, resulting in global warming.\nWith the industrial revolution in 1860, global warming has been gradually on the rise. In comparison to that period the earths core temperature has risen by two digits. It is also expected that with the current rate of global warming the earths temperature is expected to rise a further 1.5 digits within the next two decades.\nDue to the rising global temperature drastic weather changers are being experienced currently such as floods, tsunami, hurricanes etc. However minister Ranawaka further added that if the issue of global warming is not addressed the world could face further more severe and destructive natural disasters.\nHe further added that Sri Lanka too is in danger of these natural disasters, if proper preventative measures are not taken.\n",
