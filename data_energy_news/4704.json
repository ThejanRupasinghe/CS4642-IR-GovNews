Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said. He said this to the representatives of CEB Trade Unions today (14) while participating at a special talk already arranged in the premises of Power and Renewable Energy.\nThe Minister, Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya when further expressed, he said that if any injustice caused to any employee, necessary action would be taken to provide remedy. Some current issues are ones which were left by previous government. There was no such stage for them to talk about such issues. That is why they have gone for such a decision in order to protect their rights where such right time has come, the minister said. The minister further emphasized that nothing will be allowed under this situation which affects the electricity consumers.\nDeputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Hon. Ajith P. Perera was also participated at this event.\n",
